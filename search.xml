<h2 id="Buddy-Beware"><a href="#Buddy-Beware" class="headerlink" title="Buddy, Beware!"></a>Buddy, Beware!</h2><p>Seventh grade brought changes, all right, but the biggest one didn’t happen at school — it happened at home. Granddad Duncan came to live with us.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>At first it was kind of weird because none of us really knew him. Except for Mom, of course. And even though she’s spent the past year and a half trying to convince us he’s a great guy, from what I can tell, the thing he likes to do best is stare out the front-room window. There’s not much to see out there except the Bakers’ front yard, but you can find him there day or night, sitting in the big easy chair they moved in with him, staring out the window.</p>
<p>Okay, so he also reads Tom Clancy novels and the newspapers and does crossword puzzles and tracks his stocks, but those things are all distractions. Given no one to justify it to, the man would stare out the window until he fell asleep. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It just seems so … boring.</p>
<p>Mom says he stares like that because he misses Grandma, but that’s not something Granddad had ever discussed with me. As a matter of fact, he never discussed much of anything with me until a few months ago when he read about Juli in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Now, Juli Baker did not wind up on the front page of the Mayfield Times for being an eighth-grade Einstein, like you might suspect. No, my friend, she got front-page coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.</p>
<p>Not that I could tell a sycamore from a maple or a birch for that matter, but Juli, of course, knew what kind of tree it was and passed that knowledge along to every creature in her wake.</p>
<p>So this tree, this sycamore tree, was up the hill on a vacant lot on Collier Street, and it was massive. Massive and ugly. It was twisted and gnarled and bent, and I kept expecting the thing to blow over in the wind.</p>
<p>One day last year I’d finally had enough of her yakking about that stupid tree. I came right out and told her that it was not a magnificent sycamore, it was, in reality, the ugliest tree known to man. And you know what she said? She said I was visually challenged. Visually challenged! This from the girl who lives in a house that’s the scourge of the neighborhood. They’ve got bushes growing over windows, weeds sticking out all over the place, and a barnyard’s worth of animals running wild. I’m talking dogs, cats, chickens, even snakes. I swear to God, her brothers have a boa constrictor in their room. They dragged me in there when I was about ten and made me watch it eat a rat. A live, beady-eyed rat. They held that rodent up by its tail and gulp, the boa swallowed it whole. That snake gave me nightmares for a month.</p>
<p>Anyway, normally I wouldn’t care about someone’s yard, but the Bakers’ mess bugged my dad big-time, and he channeled his frustration into our yard. He said it was our neighborly duty to show them what a yard’s supposed to look like. So while Mike and Matt are busy plumping up their boa, I’m having to mow and edge our yard, then sweep the walkways and gutter, which is going a little overboard, if you ask me.</p>
<p>And you’d think Juli’s dad—who’s a big, strong, bricklaying dude — would fix the place up, but no. According to my mom, he spends all his free time painting. His landscapes don’t seem like anything special to me, but judging by his price tags, he thinks quite a lot of them. We see them every year at the Mayfield County Fair, and my parents always say the same thing: “The world would have more beauty in it if he’d fix up the yard instead.”</p>
<p>Mom and Juli’s mom do talk some. I think my mom feels sorry for Mrs. Baker — she says she married a dreamer, and because of that, one of the two of them will always be unhappy.</p>
<p>Whatever. Maybe Juli’s aesthetic sensibilities have been permanently screwed up by her father and none of this is her fault, but Juli has always thought that that sycamore tree was God’s gift to our little corner of the universe.</p>
<p>Back in the third and fourth grades she used to clown around with her brothers in the branches or peel big chunks of bark off so they could slide down the crook in its trunk. It seemed like they were playing in it whenever my mom took us somewhere in the car. Juli’d be swinging from the branches, ready to fall and break every bone in her body, while we were waiting at the stoplight, and my mom would shake her head and say, “Don’t you ever climb that tree like that, do you hear me, Bryce? I never want to see you doing that! You either, Lynetta. That is much too dangerous.”</p>
<p>My sister would roll her eyes and say, “As if,” while I’d slump beneath the window and pray for the light to change before Juli squealed my name for the world to hear.</p>
<p>I did try to climb it once in the fifth grade. It was the day after Juli had rescued my kite from its mutant toy-eating foliage. She climbed miles up to get my kite, and when she came down, she was actually very cool about it. She didn’t hold my kite hostage and stick her lips out like I was afraid she might. She just handed it over and then backed away.</p>
<p>I was relieved, but I also felt like a weenie. When I’d seen where my kite was trapped, I was sure it was a goner. Not Juli. She scrambled up and got it down in no time. Man, it was embarrassing.</p>
<p>So I made a mental picture of how high she’d climbed, and the next day I set off to outdo her by at least two branches. I made it past the crook, up a few limbs, and then — just to see how I was doing — I looked down.</p>
<p>Mis-take! It felt like I was on top of the Empire State Building without a bungee. I tried looking up to where my kite had been, but it was hopeless. I was indeed a tree-climbing weenie.</p>
<p>Then junior high started and my dream of a Juli-free existence shattered. I had to take the bus, and you-know-who did, too. There were about eight kids altogether at our bus stop, which created a buffer zone, but it was no comfort zone. Juli always tried to stand beside me, or talk to me, or in some other way mortify me.</p>
<p>And then she started climbing. The girl is in the seventh grade, and she’s climbing a tree — way, way up in a tree. And why does she do it? So she can yell down at us that the bus is five! four! three blocks away! Blow-by-blow traffic watch from a tree — what every kid in junior high feels like hearing first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>She tried to get me to come up there with her, too. “Bryce, come on! You won’t believe the colors! It’s absolutely magnificent! Bryce, you’ve got to come up here!”</p>
<p>Yeah, I could just hear it: “Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree…” Was I ever going to leave the second grade behind?</p>
<p>One morning I was specifically not looking up when out of nowhere she swings down from a branch and practically knocks me over. Heart a-ttack! I dropped my backpack and wrenched my neck, and that did it. I refused to wait under that tree with that maniac monkey on the loose anymore. I started leaving the house at the very last minute. I made up my own waiting spot, and when I’d see the bus pull up, I’d truck up the hill and get on board.</p>
<p>No Juli, no problem.</p>
<p>And that, my friend, took care of the rest of seventh grade and almost all of eighth, too, until one day a few months ago. That’s when I heard a commotion up the hill and could see some big trucks parked up on Collier Street where the bus pulls in. There were some men shouting stuff up at Juli, who was, of course, five stories up in the tree.</p>
<p>All the other kids started to gather under the tree, too, and I could hear them telling her she had to come down. She was fine — that was obvious to anyone with a pair of ears — but I couldn’t figure out what they were all arguing about.</p>
<p>I trucked up the hill, and as I got closer and saw what the men were holding, I figured out in a hurry what was making Juli refuse to come out of the tree.</p>
<p>Chain saws.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong here, okay? The tree was an ugly mutant tangle of gnarly branches. The girl arguing with those men was Juli — the world’s peskiest, bossiest, most know-it-all female. But all of a sudden my stomach completely bailed on me. Juli loved that tree. Stupid as it was, she loved that tree, and cutting it down would be like cutting out her heart.</p>
<p>Everyone tried to talk her down. Even me. But she said she wasn’t coming down, not ever, and then she tried to talk us up. “Bryce, please! Come up here with me. They won’t cut it down if we’re all up here!”</p>
<p>For a second I considered it. But then the bus arrived and I talked myself out of it. It wasn’t my tree, and even though she acted like it was, it wasn’t Juli’s, either.</p>
<p>We boarded the bus and left her behind, but school was pretty much a waste. I couldn’t seem to stop thinking about Juli. Was she still up in the tree? Were they going to arrest her?</p>
<p>When the bus dropped us off that afternoon, Juli was gone and so was half the tree. The top branches, the place my kite had been stuck, her favorite perch — they were all gone.</p>
<p>We watched them work for a little while, the chain saws gunning at full throttle, smoking as they chewed through wood. The tree looked lopsided and naked, and after a few minutes I had to get out of there. It was like watching someone dismember a body, and for the first time in ages, I felt like crying. Crying. Over a stupid tree that I hated.</p>
<p>I went home and tried to shake it off, but I kept wondering, Should I have gone up the tree with her? Would it have done any good?</p>
<p>I thought about calling Juli to tell her I was sorry they’d cut it down, but I didn’t. It would’ve been too, I don’t know, weird.</p>
<p>She didn’t show at the bus stop the next morning and didn’t ride the bus home that afternoon, either.</p>
<p>Then that night, right before dinner, my grandfather summoned me into the front room. He didn’t call to me as I was walking by — that would have bordered on friendliness. What he did was talk to my mother, who talked to me. “I don’t know what it’s about, honey,” she said. “Maybe he’s just ready to get to know you a little better.”</p>
<p>Great. The man’s had a year and a half to get acquainted, and he chooses now to get to know me. But I couldn’t exactly blow him off.</p>
<p>My grandfather’s a big man with a meaty nose and greased-back salt-and-pepper hair. He lives in house slippers and a sports coat, and I’ve never seen a whisker on him. They grow, but he shaves them off like three times a day. It’s a real recreational activity for him.</p>
<p>Besides his meaty nose, he’s also got big meaty hands. I suppose you’d notice his hands regardless, but what makes you realize just how beefy they are is his wedding ring. That thing’s never going to come off, and even though my mother says that’s how it should be, I think he ought to get it cut off. Another few pounds and that ring’s going to amputate his finger.</p>
<p>When I went in to see him, those big hands of his were woven together, resting on the newspaper in his lap. I said, “Granddad? You wanted to see me?”</p>
<p>“Have a seat, son.”</p>
<p>Son? Half the time he didn’t seem to know who I was, and now suddenly I was “son”? I sat in the chair opposite him and waited.</p>
<p>“Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.”</p>
<p>“Juli? She’s not exactly my friend … !”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” he asked. Calmly. Like he had prior knowledge.</p>
<p>I started to justify it, then stopped myself and asked, “Why do you want to know?”</p>
<p>He opened the paper and pressed down the crease, and that’s when I realized that Juli Baker had made the front page of the Mayfield Times. There was a huge picture of her in the tree, surrounded by a fire brigade and policemen, and then some smaller photos I couldn’t make out very well. “Can I see that?”</p>
<p>He folded it up but didn’t hand it over. “Why isn’t she your friend, Bryce?”</p>
<p>“Because she’s …” I shook my head and said, “You’d have to know Juli.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the girl’s got an iron backbone. Why don’t you invite her over sometime?”</p>
<p>“An iron backbone? Granddad, you don’t understand! That girl is a royal pain. She’s a show-off, she’s a know-it-all, and she is pushy beyond belief!”</p>
<p>“Is that so.”</p>
<p>“Yes! That’s absolutely so! And she’s been stalking me since the second grade!”</p>
<p>He frowned, then looked out the window and asked, “They’ve lived there that long?”</p>
<p>“I think they were all born there!”</p>
<p>He frowned some more before he looked back at me and said, “A girl like that doesn’t live next door to everyone, you know.”</p>
<p>“Lucky them!”</p>
<p>He studied me, long and hard. I said, “What?” but he didn’t flinch. He just kept staring at me, and I couldn’t take it — I had to look away.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this was the first real conversation I’d had with my grandfather. This was the first time he’d made the effort to talk to me about something besides passing the salt. And does he want to get to know me? No! He wants to know about Juli!</p>
<p>I couldn’t just stand up and leave, even though that’s what I felt like doing. Somehow I knew if I left like that, he’d quit talking to me at all. Even about salt. So I sat there feeling sort of tortured. Was he mad at me? How could he be mad at me? I hadn’t done anything wrong!</p>
<p>When I looked up, he was sitting there holding out the newspaper to me. “Read this,” he said. “Without prejudice.”</p>
<p>I took it, and when he went back to looking out the window, I knew — I’d been dismissed.</p>
<p>By the time I got down to my room, I was mad. I slammed my bedroom door and flopped down on the bed, and after fuming about my sorry excuse for a grandfather for a while, I shoved the newspaper in the bottom drawer of my desk. Like I needed to know any more about Juli Baker.</p>
<p>At dinner my mother asked me why I was so sulky, and she kept looking from me to my grandfather. Granddad didn’t seem to need any salt, which was a good thing because I might have thrown the shaker at him.</p>
<p>My sister and dad were all business as usual, though. Lynetta ate about two raisins out of her carrot salad, then peeled the skin and meat off her chicken wing and nibbled gristle off the bone, while my father filled up airspace talking about office politics and the need for a shakedown in upper management.</p>
<p>No one was listening to him — no one ever does when he gets on one of his if-I-ran-the-circus jags — but for once Mom wasn’t even pretending. And for once she wasn’t trying to convince Lynetta that dinner was delicious either. She just kept eyeing me and Granddad, trying to pick up on why we were miffed at each other.</p>
<p>Not that he had anything to be miffed at me about. What had I done to him, anyway? Nothing. Nada. But he was, I could tell. And I completely avoided looking at him until about halfway through dinner, when I sneaked a peek.</p>
<p>He was studying me, all right. And even though it wasn’t a mean stare, or a hard stare, it was, you know, firm. Steady. And it weirded me out. What was his deal?</p>
<p>I didn’t look at him again. Or at my mother. I just went back to eating and pretended to listen to my dad. And the first chance I got, I excused myself and holed up in my room.</p>
<p>I was planning to call my friend Garrett like I usually do when I’m bent about something. I even punched in his number, but I don’t know. I just hung up.</p>
<p>And later when my mom came in, I faked like I was sleeping. I haven’t done that in years. The whole night was weird like that. I just wanted to be left alone.</p>
<p>Juli wasn’t at the bus stop the next morning. Or Friday morning. She was at school, but you’d never know it if you didn’t actually look. She didn’t whip her hand through the air trying to get the teacher to call on her or charge through the halls getting to class. She didn’t make unsolicited comments for the teacher’s edification or challenge the kids who took cuts in the milk line. She just sat. Quiet.</p>
<p>I told myself I should be glad about it — it was like she wasn’t even there, and isn’t that what I’d always wanted? But still, I felt bad. About her tree, about how she hurried off to eat by herself in the library at lunch, about how her eyes were red around the edges. I wanted to tell her, Man, I’m sorry about your sycamore tree, but the words never seemed to come out.</p>
<p>By the middle of the next week, they’d finished taking down the tree. They cleared the lot and even tried to pull up the stump, but that sucker would not budge, so they wound up grinding it down into the dirt.</p>
<p>Juli still didn’t show at the bus stop, and by the end of the week I learned from Garrett that she was riding a bike. He said he’d seen her on the side of the road twice that week, putting the chain back on the derailleur of a rusty old ten-speed.</p>
<p>I figured she’d be back. It was a long ride out to Mayfield Junior High, and once she got over the tree, she’d start riding the bus again. I even caught myself looking for her. Not on the lookout, just looking.</p>
<p>Then one day it rained and I thought for sure she’d be up at the bus stop, but no. Garrett said he saw her trucking along on her bike in a bright yellow poncho, and in math I noticed that her pants were still soaked from the knees down.</p>
<p>When math let out, I started to chase after her to tell her that she ought to try riding the bus again, but I stopped myself in the nick of time. What was I thinking? That Juli wouldn’t take a little friendly concern and completely misinterpret it? Whoa now, buddy, beware! Better to just leave well enough alone.</p>
<p>After all, the last thing I needed was for Juli Baker to think I missed her.</p>

<h2 id="Main-idea"><a href="#Main-idea" class="headerlink" title="Main idea:"></a>Main idea:</h2><p>The first chapter mainly describes the subtle relationship between two people. Julie falls in love with the protagonist Bryce. Unfortunately, Bryce believes that Julie’s enthusiasm is a troublesome behavior. Bryce’s mother did not sympathize with her son because she even wanted him to make friends with Julie. In addition, Bryce’s sister has been helping Julie find Bryce, and she has been bullying Bryce. All of this makes his escaping plan difficult. Bryce has his father as a helper.His father doesn’t like Juli because she is  domineering and dressed in mud. Even though Bryce avoided Julie through a series of things such as searching for her enemies, they ultimately failed, and even worse, their seats at school were too close.<br>However, in fifth and sixth grade, their relationship became more delicate .Julie enjoyed spending time with Bryce, especially smelling his hair. Bryce relied heavily on Julie for homework.Although it’s painful to be in front of Julie，however, he didn’t expect Julie to pass on the answer to him by sniffing his hair, which could be seen as a wonderful ‘collaboration’!</p>
<h2 id="My-reflection"><a href="#My-reflection" class="headerlink" title="My reflection:"></a>My reflection:</h2><p> The author excels in describing characters through action chains, and her portrayal of Bryce and Bryce’s inner entanglement is truly amazing! The subtle relationship between the two is very comical, but the author leaves a suspense. Can Bryce get rid of the annoying Julie by entering middle school?</p>

    <title>Flipped阅读笔记-Chapter2</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Flipped-TEXT"><a href="#Flipped-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="Flipped [TEXT]"></a>Flipped [TEXT]</h2><p>The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped. Honestly, one look at him and I became a lunatic. It’s his eyes. Something in his eyes. They’re blue, and framed in the blackness of his lashes, they’re dazzling. Absolutely breathtaking.</p>
<p>It’s been over six years now, and I learned long ago to hide my feelings, but oh, those first days. Those first years! I thought I would die for wanting to be with him.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Two days before the second grade is when it started, although the anticipation began weeks before—ever since my mother had told me that there was a family with a boy my age moving into the new house right across the street.<br>Soccer camp had ended, and I’d been so bored because there was nobody, absolutely nobody, in the neighborhood to play with. Oh, there were kids, but every one of them was older. That was dandy for my brothers, but what it left me was home alone.</p>
<p>My mother was there, but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around. So she said, anyway. At the time I didn’t think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around, especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming, but my mother didn’t agree. And the danger of being home alone with her was that she’d recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum, and she wouldn’t tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as I moved from chore to chore.</p>
<p>To play it safe, I waited outside for weeks, just in case the new neighbors moved in early. Literally, it was weeks. I entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog, Champ. Mostly he’d just block because a dog can’t exactly kick and score, but once in a while he’d dribble with his nose. The scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog, though, because Champ would eventually try to chomp it, then lose the ball to me.</p>
<p>When the Loskis’ moving van finally arrived, everyone in my family was happy. “Little Julianna” was finally going to have a playmate.</p>
<p>My mother, being the truly sensible adult that she is, made me wait more than an hour before going over to meet him. “Give them a chance to stretch their legs, Julianna,” she said. “They’ll want some time to adjust.” She wouldn’t even let me watch from the yard. “I know you, sweetheart. Somehow that ball will wind up in their yard and you’ll just have to go retrieve it.”</p>
<p>So I watched from the window, and every few minutes I’d ask, “Now?” and she’d say, “Give them a little while longer, would you?”</p>
<p>Then the phone rang. And the minute I was sure she was good and preoccupied, I tugged on her sleeve and asked, “Now?”</p>
<p>She nodded and whispered, “Okay, but take it easy! I’ll be over there in a minute.”</p>
<p>I was too excited not to charge across the street, but I did try very hard to be civilized once I got to the moving van. I stood outside looking in for a record-breaking length of time, which was hard because there he was! About halfway back! My new sure-to-be best friend, Bryce Loski.</p>
<p>Bryce wasn’t really doing much of anything. He was more hanging back, watching his father move boxes onto the lift-gate. I remember feeling sorry for Mr. Loski because he looked worn out, moving boxes all by himself. I also remember that he and Bryce were wearing matching turquoise polo shirts, which I thought was really cute. Really nice.</p>
<p>When I couldn’t stand it any longer, I called, “Hi!” into the van, which made Bryce jump, and then quick as a cricket, he started pushing a box like he’d been working all along.</p>
<p>I could tell from the way Bryce was acting so guilty that he was supposed to be moving boxes, but he was sick of it. He’d probably been moving things for days! It was easy to see that he needed a rest. He needed some juice! Something.</p>
<p>It was also easy to see that Mr. Loski wasn’t about to let him quit. He was going to keep on moving boxes around until he collapsed, and by then Bryce might be dead. Dead before he’d had the chance to move in!</p>
<p>The tragedy of it catapulted me into the moving van. I had to help! I had to save him!</p>
<p>When I got to his side to help him shove a box forward, the poor boy was so exhausted that he just moved aside and let me take over. Mr. Loski didn’t want me to help, but at least I saved Bryce. I’d been in the moving van all of three minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mother unpack things inside the house.</p>
<p>I chased Bryce up the walkway, and that’s when everything changed. You see, I caught up to him and grabbed his arm, trying to stop him so maybe we could play a little before he got trapped inside, and the next thing I know he’s holding my hand, looking right into my eyes.</p>
<p>My heart stopped. It just stopped beating. And for the first time in my life, I had that feeling. You know, like the world is moving all around you, all beneath you, all inside you, and you’re floating. Floating in midair. And the only thing keeping you from drifting away is the other person’s eyes. They’re connected to yours by some invisible physical force, and they hold you fast while the rest of the world swirls and twirls and falls completely away.</p>
<p>I almost got my first kiss that day. I’m sure of it. But then his mother came out the front door and he was so embarrassed that his cheeks turned completely red, and the next thing you know he’s hiding in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I was waiting for him to come out when his sister, Lynetta, saw me in the hallway. She seemed big and mature to me, and since she wanted to know what was going on, I told her a little bit about it. I shouldn’t have, though, because she wiggled the bathroom doorknob and started teasing Bryce something fierce. “Hey, baby brother!” she called through the door. “There’s a hot chick out here waiting for you! Whatsa matter? Afraid she’s got cooties?”</p>
<p>It was so embarrassing! I yanked on her arm and told her to stop it, but she wouldn’t, so finally I just left.</p>
<p>I found my mother outside talking to Mrs. Loski. Mom had given her the beautiful lemon Bundt cake that was supposed to be our dessert that night. The powdered sugar looked soft and white, and the cake was still warm, sending sweet lemon smells into the air.</p>
<p>My mouth was watering just looking at it! But it was in Mrs. Loski’s hands, and I knew there was no getting it back. All I could do was try to eat up the smells while I listened to the two of them discuss grocery stores and the weather forecast.</p>
<p>After that Mom and I went home. It was very strange. I hadn’t gotten to play with Bryce at all. All I knew was that his eyes were a dizzying blue, that he had a sister who was not to be trusted, and that he’d almost kissed me.</p>
<p>I fell asleep that night thinking about the kiss that might have been. What did a kiss feel like, anyway? Somehow I knew it wouldn’t be like the one I got from Mom or Dad at bedtime. The same species, maybe, but a radically different beast, to be sure. Like a wolf and a whippet—only science would put them on the same tree.</p>
<p>Looking back on the second grade, I like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss, but to be honest, it was probably more those blue eyes. All through the second and third grades I couldn’t seem to stop myself from following him, from sitting by him, from just wanting to be near him.</p>
<p>By the fourth grade I’d learned to control myself. The sight of him—the thought of him—still sent my heart humming, but my legs didn’t actually chase after him anymore. I just watched and thought and dreamed.</p>
<p>Then in the fifth grade Shelly Stalls came into the picture. Shelly Stalls is a ninny. A whiny, gossipy, backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another. Now that we’re in junior high, she’s the undisputed diva of drama, but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance. Especially when it came to P.E. I never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics. Instead, she would go into her “delicate” act, claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched.</p>
<p>It worked. Every year. She’d bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year, after which she’d be excused from anything that required muscles. She never even put up her own chair at the end of the day. The only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth, and those she worked out nonstop. If there was an Olympic contest for talking, Shelly Stalls would sweep the event. Well, she’d at least win the gold and silver— one medal for each side of her mouth.</p>
<p>What bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of P.E.—who’d want her on their team, anyway? What bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasn’t asthma or weak ankles or her being “delicate” that was stopping her. It was her hair. She had mountains of it, twisted this way or that, clipped or beaded, braided or swirled. Her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses. And on the days she let it all hang down, she’d sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket, so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose. Good luck playing four-square with a blanket over your head.</p>
<p>My solution to Shelly Stalls was to ignore her, which worked just dandy until about halfway through the fifth grade when I saw her holding hands with Bryce.</p>
<p>My Bryce. The one who was still embarrassed over holding my hand two days before the second grade. The one who was still too shy to say much more than hello to me.</p>
<p>The one who was still walking around with my first kiss.</p>
<p>How could Shelly have wormed her hand into his? That pushy little princess had no business hanging on to him like that!</p>
<p>Bryce looked over his shoulder from time to time as they walked along, and he was looking at me. My first thought was that he was telling me he was sorry. Then it dawned on me— he needed my help. Absolutely, that’s what it had to be! Shelly Stalls was too delicate to shake off, too swirly to be pushed away. She’d unravel and start sniffling and oh, how embarrassing that would be for him! No, this wasn’t a job a boy could do gracefully. This was a job for a girl.</p>
<p>I didn’t even bother checking around for other candidates—I had her off of him in two seconds flat. Bryce ran away the minute he was free, but not Shelly. Oh, no-no-no! She came at me, scratching and pulling and twisting anything she could get her hands on, telling me that Bryce was hers and there was no way she was letting him go.</p>
<p>How delicate.</p>
<p>I was hoping for herds of teachers to appear so they could see the real Shelly Stalls in action, but it was too late by the time anyone arrived on the scene. I had Fluffy in a headlock and her arm twisted back in a hammerlock, and no amount of her squawking or scratching was going to get me to un lock her until a teacher arrived.</p>
<p>In the end, Shelly went home early with a bad case of mussed-up hair, while I told my side of things to the principal. Mrs. Shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed, and although she told me that it would be better if I let other people work out their own dilemmas, she definitely understood about Shelly Stalls and her hair and told me she was glad I’d had the self-control to do nothing more than restrain her.</p>
<p>Shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids. And of course she got everybody whispering about me, but I just ignored them. The facts spoke for themselves. Bryce didn’t go anywhere near her for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Bryce held my hand after that, but he did start being a little friendlier to me. Especially in the sixth grade, after Mr. Mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Bryce was nice. He was nice. He’d say Hi, Juli to me every morning, and once in a while I’d catch him looking my way. He’d always blush and go back to his own work, and I couldn’t help but smile. He was so shy. And so cute!</p>
<p>We talked to each other more, too. Especially after Mr. Mertins moved me behind him. Mr. Mertins had a detention policy about spelling, where if you missed more than seven out of twenty-five words, you had to spend lunch inside with him, writing your words over and over and over again.</p>
<p>The pressure of detention made Bryce panic. And even though it bothered my conscience, I’d lean in and whisper answers to him, hoping that maybe I could spend lunch with him instead. His hair smelled like watermelon, and his ear-lobes had fuzz. Soft, blond fuzz. And I wondered about that. How does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz? What’s it doing there, anyway? I checked my own ear-lobes in the mirror but couldn’t find much of anything on them, and I didn’t spot any on other people’s either.</p>
<p>I thought about asking Mr. Mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science, but I didn’t. Instead, I spent the year whispering spelling words, sniffing watermelon, and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.</p>

<p>　　月日，白居易，微之足下：自从足下被贬到江陵府到现在，你赠送和酬答我的诗已近一百首了。每逢寄诗来，你还不辞辛苦，有时作序，有时写信，都冠在卷头。这都是用来阐述古今诗歌的意义，并且说明自己做文章的缘由和年月的先后的。我既然接受了你的诗，又理解了你这番意图，也就常常想要回答来信，概略地谈谈诗歌的基本道理，并陈述自己做文章的意图，总起来写一封信，送到足下面前。但是，几年以来，为事故拖累，很少空睱。偶然有了空闲，有时想做这件事，又想到我所说的并没有超出足下的见解，所以有好几次都是铺开信纸又做罢了的。最终没能实现过去的心愿，直到如今。</p>

<p>　　今俟罪浔阳，除盥栉食寝外无余事，因览足下去通州日所留新旧文二十六轴，开卷得意，忽如会面，心所蓄者，便欲快言，往往自疑，不知相去万里也。既而愤悱之气，思有所泄，遂追就前志，勉为此书，足下幸试为仆留意一省。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　现在被贬调到浔阳任职，除去起居饮食之外，没有别的事可做，于是就浏览你到通州去时留下的二十六轴新旧文章，开卷阅读领会其中的含意，真好像和你会面谈心一样。我长时蓄积于内心的想法，便想一吐为快，恍恍惚惚感觉你还在面前，竟忘记了你是在遥远的通州。从而，我的郁积不平的感情想要有所发泄，于是就回忆起从前的心愿，勉力地写了这封信。希望足下为我用心看一看，是很以为荣幸的。</p>

<p>　　夫文，尚矣，三才各有文。天之文三光首之；地之文五材首之；人之文六经首之。就六经言，诗又首之。何者？圣人感人心而天下和平。感人心者，莫先乎情，莫始乎言，莫切乎声，莫深乎义。诗者，根情，苗言，华声，实义。上自圣贤，下至愚騃，微及豚鱼，幽及鬼神。群分而气同，形异而情一。未有声入而不应、情交而不感者。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　所谓文，起源真是太久远了。三才都有自己的文：上天的文，以三光为首；大地的文，以五材为首；人间的文，以六经为首。就拿六经来说，《诗经》又是为首的。为什么呢？因为圣人就是用诗感化人心，而使天下和平的。能够感化人心的事物，没有比情先的，没有比言早的，没有比声近的，没有比义深的。所谓诗，就是以情为根，以诗为苗，以声为花，以义为实的。上自圣贤，下至愚人，微小如豚鱼，幽隐如鬼神，种类有别而气质相同，形体各异而感情一致。接受声音的刺激而不产生反响，接触到情感的影响而内心不感应，这样的事是没有的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　圣人知其然，因其言，经之以六义；缘其声，纬之以五音。音有韵，义有类。韵协则言顺，言顺则声易入；类举则情见，情见则感易交。于是乎孕大含深，贯微洞密，上下通而一气泰，忧乐合而百志熙。五帝三皇所以直道而行、垂拱而理者，揭此以为大柄，決此以为大宝也。故闻“元首明，股肱良”之歌，则知虞道昌矣。闻五子洛汭之歌，则知夏政荒矣。言者无罪，闻者足诫，言者闻者莫不两尽其心焉。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　圣人懂得这个道理，就根据言语的状况，把它纳入六义，按照声音的形态，把它鎔入五音，使之合于规范。五音有规律，六义有类分。韵律协调言语就通顺，语言顺畅声音就容易动人。类分明确情感就得以表现，情感得以表现就容易感人。这样一来，其中就包含着博大精深的道理，贯穿着隐密细微的事物。天子和平民就以上下沟通，天地之气就能彼此相交，人们的忧乐相同，人人的心意也就达到和乐。三皇五帝所以按正确的道理去办事，垂衣拱手就把国家治理很好，原因就在于掌握了诗的义和音，把这作为主要权衡；也辩明了诗的义和言，把这作为主要的法宝。因此，听到“元首明，股肱良”这样的歌，就知道虞舜时代治道昌明。听到五子洛汭这样的歌，就知道夏太康的政事已经荒废。用诗讽谕的人没有罪过，听到这种讽喻的人可以作为戒鉴。实行讽谕的和听到这到讽谕的各尽自己的心力。</p>

<p>　　洎周衰秦兴，采诗官废，上不以诗补察时政，下不以歌泄导人情。用至于谄成之风动，救失之道缺。于时六义始刓矣。国风变为骚辞，五言始于苏、李。诗骚皆不遇者，各系其志，发而为文。故河梁之句，止于伤别；泽畔之吟，归于怨思。彷徨抑郁，不暇及他耳。然去《诗》未远，梗概尚存。故兴离别则引双凫一雁为喻，讽君子小人则引香草恶鸟为比。虽义类不具，犹得风人之什二三焉。于时六义始缺矣。晋、宋已还，得者盖寡。以康乐之奥博，多溺于山水；以渊明之高古，偏放于田园。江、鲍之流，又狭于此。如梁鸿《五噫》之例者，百无一二。于时六义浸微矣！陵夷至于梁、陈间，率不过嘲风雪、弄花草而已。噫！风雪花草之物，三百篇中岂舍之乎？顾所用何如耳。设如“北风其凉”，假风以刺威虐也；“雨雪霏霏”，因雪以愍征役；“棠棣之华”，感华以讽兄弟；“采采芣苡”，美草以乐有子也。皆兴发于此而义归于彼。反是者，可乎哉！然则“余霞散成绮，澄江净如练”，“归花先委露，别叶乍辞风”之什，丽则丽矣，吾不知其所讽焉。故仆所谓嘲风雪、弄花草而已。于时六义尽去矣。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　到了东周衰落秦国兴起的时候，采诗之官就废除了。天子不以采诗观风的办法补救并考察政事的缺失，平民也不以诗歌宣泄疏导自己的感情。于是颂扬成绩的风气兴起来，补救政事缺失的道理遭到破坏。这时候，六义就不完整了。国风演变为楚辞、五言诗开始于苏武、李陵。苏武、李陵、屈原遭遇都不好，他们都切合自己的情志，抒发感慨而写成诗文。因此，“携手上河梁”之类的诗句，仅止于表达离别的伤感，“行吟泽畔”这样的吟咏最终也只归于怨愤的思绪。诗中所表达的尽是彷徨难舍，抑郁愁苦，没有写到别的内容。但是距离《诗经》还相去不远，六义的大概还保存着。因此，描写离别就以双凫一雁起兴，讽咏君子小人就用香草恶鸟打比方。虽然六义不完全，还能得到国风传统的十分之二三。这时候，六义就缺欠了。晋宋以来，得到国风传统的大概就罕见了。如谢康乐诗的深奥博大，但是多耽溺于山水。如陶渊明诗的超拨古朴，但是又多放情于田园。江淹、鲍照之辈，又比这些诗还要偏狭。象梁鸿所写的《五噫歌》那样的例子，连百分之一二也没有。这时候，六义就逐渐微弱，走向衰落了。到了梁、陈中间，大都不过是玩弄风雪、花草而已。唉，风雪花草这类事物，《三百篇》中难道就割弃了吗？这只是看运用如何罢了。比如“北风其凉”，就是借风以讽刺威虐的，“雨雪霏霏”，就是借怜悯征役的，“棠棣之华”是有感于花而讽谕兄弟之道的，“采采苢”，是赞美车前草而祝贺妇人有子的。这都是以风雪花草起兴，而表现的意义则在于刺威虐、愍征役、讽兄弟、乐有子的。与此相反怎么可以呢？这样，“余霞散成，澄江静如练”，“离花先委露，别叶乍辞风”这类篇章，辞确实华丽，我不知道它所讽谕的究竟是什么。因此，我说这些诗仅仅是玩弄风雪花草罢了。这时候，六义就完全消失了。</p>

<p>　　唐兴二百年，其间诗人不可胜数。所可举者，陈子昂有《感遇》诗二十首，鲍防《感兴》诗十五篇。又诗之豪者，世称李、杜。李之作，才矣！奇矣！人不迨矣！索其风雅比兴，十无一焉。杜诗最多，可传者千余首。至于贯穿古今，覙缕格律，尽工尽善，又过于李焉。然撮其《新安》《石壕》《潼关吏》《芦子关》《花门》之章，“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”之句，亦不过三四十首。杜尚如此，况不迨杜者乎？仆常痛诗道崩坏，忽忽愤发，或废食辍寝，不量才力，欲扶起之。嗟乎！事有大谬者，又不可一二而言，然亦不能不粗陈于左右。  </p>

<p>　　大唐已经兴盛两百年了，其间的诗人不可胜数。值得一提的，陈子昂有《感遇诗》二十首，鲍防有《感兴诗》十五首。还有诗中的豪杰，世人把他们并称称为“李杜”。李白的作品，才华出群，不同凡响，普通人没办法与之相比！但是，探索其中的六义，在十首之中连一首也不具备。杜甫的作品最多，可以流传下来的有一千多首。至于贯通古今，格律运用纯熟，做到了尽善尽美，又超过了李白。但是举出《新安吏》、《石壕吏》、《潼关吏》、《塞芦子》、《留花门》这样的篇章，“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨“这样的诗句，也不过三四十首。杜甫尚且如此，何况不如杜甫的呢？ 我经常对诗道的破坏感到痛心，恍恍惚惚地就激愤起来，有时正在吃饭就吃不下去了，夜里睡不着觉。我没有估量自己才力的不足，就想马上恢复起来。唉！事竟与愿违，又不是几句话可以说尽的，但是还不能不向您粗略地陈述一番。</p>

<p>　　仆始生六七月时，乳母抱弄于书屏下，有指“之”字、“无”字示仆者，仆口未能言，心已默识。后有问此二字者，虽百十其试，而指之不差。则知仆宿习之缘，已在文字中矣。及五六岁，便学为诗。九岁谙识声韵。十五六，始知有进士，苦节读书。二十已来，昼课赋，夜课书，间又课诗，不遑寝息矣。以至于口舌成疮，手肘成胝。既壮而肤革不丰盈，未老而齿发早衰白；瞀瞀然如飞蝇垂珠在眸子中者，动以万数，盖以苦学力文之所致，又自悲矣。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　我出生六七个月的时候，乳母抱着我在书屏下边玩，有人指着无字之字教给我。我虽然嘴上说不出来，但是心里已经默默地记住了。后来有人拿这两个字问我，即使试验十次百次，我都能准确地指出来。那么我是生来就与文字有缘了。到五六岁，就学习做诗，九岁通晓声韵，十五六岁开始知道考中进士的荣耀，就刻苦读书、二十岁以来，白天学习做赋，夜里刻苦读书，间或也学习做诗，没有空闲时间睡眠休息。甚至于嘴和舌头都生疮，手和肘都磨成茧。眸子里面总是一晃一晃的，好象飞着挂着珠，动不动就以万计。这大概是刻苦学习奋力做诗造成的，自己感到很悲哀。</p>

<p>　　家贫多故，二十七方从乡赋。既第之后，虽专于科试，亦不废诗。及授校书郎时，已盈三四百首。或出示交友如足下辈，见皆谓之工，其实未窥作者之域耳。自登朝来，年齿渐长，阅事渐多。每与人言，多询时务；每读书史，多求理道。始知文章合为时而著，歌诗合为事而作。是时皇帝初即位，宰府有正人，屡降玺书，访人急病。  </p>

<p>　　因家庭贫困而又多事故，直到二十七岁我才应进士试。考中以后，虽然专心于分科考试，还是没有停止做诗。到了做校书郎的时候，诗作足有三四百首。有时拿出来让足下这样的朋友们看。大家一见都说写得工巧，其实我并没有达到诗作者的水平。自从到朝廷作官以来，年龄渐长，经历的事情也渐多，每逢与人谈话，多询问时政，每逢读书史，多探求治理国家的道理。这才知道文章应该为时事而著作，诗歌应该为现实而创作。这时候，皇帝刚刚继位，政府之中有正直的人士，屡次下诏书，调查人民的疾苦。</p>

<p>　　仆当此日，擢在翰林，身是谏官，月请谏纸。启奏之间，有可以救济人病，裨补时阙，而难于指言者，辄咏歌之，欲稍稍递进闻于上。上以广宸听，副忧勤；次以酬恩奖，塞言责；下以复吾平生之志。岂图志未就而悔已生，言未闻而谤已成矣！  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　我正是在这时升做翰林学士，又做左拾遗的官，亲手领取写谏章的用纸，除写奏章直接向皇帝陈述意见之外，有可以解救人民疾苦，弥补时政的缺失，而又难于直接说明的事项，就写成诗歌，慢慢地让皇帝知道。首先是用来开阔皇帝的见闻，对他考虑和处理国家大事有所帮助。其次是报答皇帝的恩情奖励，尽到谏官的职责。最后是实现个人平生振兴诗道的心愿。没有想到，心愿没有实现而悔恨已经产，诗歌没有闻于上，而诽谤却已经形成了。</p>

<p>　　又请为左右终言之。凡闻仆《贺雨》诗，众口籍籍，以为非宜矣；闻仆《哭孔戡》诗，众面脉脉，尽不悦矣；闻《秦中吟》，则权豪贵近者，相目而变色矣；闻《登乐游园》寄足下诗，则执政柄者扼腕矣；闻《宿紫阁村》诗，则握军要者切齿矣！大率如此，不可遍举。不相与者，号为沽誉，号为诋讦，号为讪谤。苟相与者，则如牛僧孺之诫焉。乃至骨肉妻孥，皆以我为非也。其不我非者，举世不过三两人。有邓鲂者，见仆诗而喜，无何鲂死。有唐衢者，见仆诗而泣，未几而衢死。其余即足下。足下又十年来困踬若此。呜呼！岂六义四始之风，天将破坏，不可支持耶？抑又不知天意不欲使下人病苦闻于上耶？不然，何有志于诗者，不利若此之甚也！然仆又自思关东一男子耳，除读书属文外，其他懵然无知，乃至书画棋博，可以接群居之欢者，一无通晓，即其愚拙可知矣！初应进士时，中朝无缌麻之亲，达官无半面之旧；策蹇步于利足之途，张空拳于战文之场。十年之间，三登科第，名落众耳，迹升清贯，出交贤俊，入侍冕旒。始得名于文章，终得罪于文章，亦其宜也。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　我还要请你允许我把这件事彻底地说说。凡是听到我的《贺雨诗》，众人就一起喧嚷起来，已经认为不合适了。听到我的《哭孔戡诗》，众人就面呈怒色，都不高兴了。听到《秦中吟》，有权势的显贵和近臣都相视变色。听到我的乐游园寄足下诗，执政者就扼腕痛恨。听到我的《宿紫阁村诗》，掌握军权的人就切齿痛恨。大都这样，不能全都举出了。与我没有交谊的人说我是沽名钓誉，恶意攻击，嘲笑诽谤。假使是与我有交谊的，就以牛僧孺揭露时政而被斥逐的教训警戒我，甚而我的兄弟妻子都认为我是错的。那认为我没错的，整个世上也不过二三个人。有一个邓鲂，看见我的诗就高兴，不久他就死了。还有一个唐衢，读了我的诗就哭泣，不久唐衢也死去了。另外就是你的情况了，而你十年来又困顿到这步田地。唉！难道六义四始的传统，上天就要破坏它而不能支持了吗？还是我不知道上天的意愿就是不让人民疾苦闻于皇帝呢？要不然的话，为什么有志于做诗的人不顺利到这样严重的地步呢？ 但是，我自己也思量过，我只不过是关东一个普通人罢了。除去读书作文之外，其它事是胡胡涂涂一无所知，甚至连书法、绘画、弈棋、博戏那样可以与众人交换联欢的事，我都一无通晓。就是说，我的愚笨是可想而知了。当初应进士试的时候，朝廷里面连一个疏远的亲戚也没有，达官之中连一个曾有过一面之识的朋友也没有。争取功名我不善于奔走趋附。科举考试我也没有可靠的凭借。但是，十年之间我却三次中第，名声为众人所知，足迹达到侍从之官。在朝廷之外与贤俊之士相交结，在朝廷之中就服侍皇帝。开始我是由于文章知名的，最后又由于文章获罪，那也是应该的。</p>

<p>　　日者闻亲友间说，礼、吏部举选人，多以仆私试赋判为准的。其余诗句，亦往往在人口中。仆恧然自愧，不之信也。及再来长安，又闻有军使高霞寓者，欲聘倡妓，妓大夸曰：“我诵得白学士《长恨歌》，岂同他哉？”由是增价。又足下书云：到通州日，见江馆柱间有题仆诗者。何人哉？又昨过汉南日，适遇主人集众娱乐，他宾诸妓见仆来，指而相顾曰：此是《秦中吟》《长恨歌》主耳。自长安抵江西三四千里，凡乡校、佛寺、逆旅、行舟之中，往往有题仆诗者；士庶、僧徒、孀妇、处女之口，每有咏仆诗者。此诚雕篆之戏，不足为多，然今时俗所重，正在此耳。虽前贤如渊、云者，前辈如李、杜者，亦未能忘情于其间。  </p>

<p>　　最近，又听亲戚朋友们私下说：礼部、吏部举行赞扬人才的考试，多用我应试的赋和判词做为标准。其余诗句，也经常在人们的口上流传。我感到很惭愧，也不相信这件事。到第二次来长安的时候，又听说有个军使高霞寓，要聘娶一个歌妓。歌妓大夸其口说：“我能唱白学士的《长恨歌》，怎么能同别的歌妓一样呢？”因此，就抬高了身价。足下书信中还说过，到通州的时候，看见近江的客舍柱子上有题写我的诗的，那又是谁呢？以往我经过汉南的时候，恰好赶上主人集合一群歌妓，为别的宾客做乐。那些歌妓看我来了，就指着我互相使眼色说：“这就是《秦中吟》、《长恨歌》的作者。”从长安直到江西，一路三四千里，凡是地方学校、佛寺、施舍、行舟之中，经常有题写我的诗的，平民、僧众、寡妇、未嫁的姑娘也总有歌唱我的诗的。这的确是微末的小枝，没什么值得称道的，但是现在时俗所重视的，也正是在这一点上。即使前代有才能的人物如王褒、扬雄，前辈如李白、杜甫，心情也是注重这一点的。</p>

<p>　　微之，尊重耳闻的，轻视眼见的，崇尚古代的，看不起今天的，是人的常情。我不能远追古代的旧闻做证明，就像近年韦苏州的歌行，除去才气超拨，词藻华丽之外，很接近于以兴的手法表达讽谕的意义。他的五言诗又高超雅正，安详适静，是自成一家的体制。现在的作者谁能赶得上呢？但是韦苏州在世的时候，人们并不太重视，一定等到诗人死后，人们才珍重他的作品。现在我的诗，人们喜爱的，通通不过杂律诗和《长恨歌》以下那些作品。时俗所重视的，正是我所轻视的。至于那些讽谕诗，意思激切而言语质直，闲适诗思虑恬静，文词迂缓。由于质直并迂缓，人们不喜爱也是应该的了。现在爱我的诗，与我同时活在世上的，就只有足下而已。但是，千百年后，怎么能知道再没有象足下这样的人出现，而了解并喜爱我的诗呢？因此，八九年来，我与足下做官顺利，就以诗互相鉴戒，遭到斥逐就以诗互相慰勉，各自独居的时候就以诗互相告慰，住在一起的时候就以诗互相娱乐。与我相交的和谴责我的，大都由于诗呵！</p>

<p>　　正在这个时候，你的兴致还有余，还要与我把交往的友人的诗全部索取来，选择其中最好的，譬如张十八的古乐府，李二十的新歌行，卢拱、杨巨源二秘书的律诗，窦七、元八的绝句，广泛地搜集，精心地选取，把它们编辑起来，称为《元白往还诗集》。诸位君子得知考虑编选他们的诗这件事，没有不雀跃高兴的，把这看做一件大事。唉！计划没有实现，你就被降职调离，不几个月我也接着被贬官了。性情没有兴致，什么时候能完成，又要为这件事叹息了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　仆常语足下，凡人为文，私于自是，不忍于割截，或失于繁多。其间妍媸益又自惑。必待交友有公鉴无姑息者，讨论而削夺之，然后繁简当否，得其中矣。况仆与足下，为文尤患其多。己尚病之，况他人乎？今且各纂诗笔，粗为卷第，待与足下相见日，各出所有，终前志焉。又不知相遇是何年，相见是何地，溘然而至，则如之何？微之知我心哉！  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　我曾经跟你说，任何人做文章，都偏私以为自己的好，不忍心删削，有时缺点就在繁多上，其间好坏自己又辨别不清，一定得依靠朋友做出公允的评价而不加宽容，进行讨论删削，这样以后繁简恰当不恰当才能处理合适。况且我与足下，写文章特别怕繁多，自己尚且认为是毛病，何况他人呢？现在我们暂且分别编辑诗文，粗略地分出卷次，等到我和足下相见的时候，各人都拿出自己编辑过的东西，以完成过去的心愿。但是，又不知何年能相遇，何地能相见，死期一到，该怎么办呵！微之微之，知道我的心吗？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　浔阳腊月，江风苦寒，岁暮鲜欢，夜长少睡。引笔铺纸，悄然灯前，有念则书，言无铨次。勿以繁杂为倦，且以代一夕之话言也。  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>　　浔阳腊月，江风吹来，感到凄苦寒冷。岁末很少欢趣，长夜无眠。拿来笔铺下纸，寂静地坐在灯前，想到哪儿就写到哪儿，语无伦次，请不要厌烦我的繁杂，暂且用以代替一夕之话吧。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>　　微之微之！知我心哉！乐天再拜。  </p>

    <title>人其实高不过一棵庄稼</title>
    <url>/2023/09/11/%E4%BA%BA%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%9E%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%8D%E8%BF%87%E4%B8%80%E6%A3%B5%E5%BA%84%E7%A8%BC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>作者:宋长征<br>  人住在村子里，养鸡，喂狗，用铡刀铡碎一捆青草，是为了一头牛青青黄黄的日子。鸡会打鸣，会下蛋，会在村前的小河滩上领着一帮子女逮蚂蚱。人也想，可是脱不开身呀，村外的田里种着庄稼，村子里整天发生着大大小小的事情。所以，人想活成一只鸡都不成；再说，鸡的下场也不怎么光荣。狗最会看家，看似卧在墙根下，眯缝着眼，稍有动静，就红了眼，把一个“汪”字重复喊了很多遍。其实，见你一哈腰，便弓了身子，夹起尾巴，钻进一个柴草窠里，再不愿管别人的闲事。人不像狗，要不然，活得多没意义。</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>  牛呢，我不说你也知道。主人下地了，被拴在林东的一棵歪脖子柳树上，日头在东，在西边卧；日头爬上南天门，就靠紧了柳树根。嘴倒嚼着，尾巴甩来甩去，也拍不到一只苍蝇；日头落在屋檐上的时候，牛们大都站起身来，朝着庄稼地的方向，哞——哞——喊了两嗓子，不大会儿就有人走了过来。天就黑了。</p>
<p>  庄稼住在地里。南岗子，西水洼，起起伏伏，不咋平坦的老河滩上都是庄稼的家。眼下，庄稼做不了自己的主，村子里住的有的是人。别看平常不怎么出来，开春了，动镰了，一个个像从战壕里跃出来的士兵，跟无形的时光拼着抢着，不过是为了果腹，重复上演着祖先继续了很多年的战争。庄稼一开始不大理会这个，好像有了人，日子便再不会像草那么索然无趣。老河滩上的草就没人管，发芽了，开花了，结果了。羊呢，比较挑嘴，喜欢的，抿在嘴里，不紧不慢，咀嚼着光阴；不喜欢的，比如刺老牙，打了个响鼻，分明在告诉自己的子女：那玩意儿碰不得。</p>
<p>  至于庄稼到底羡不羡慕草的活法，这个你得问庄稼。反正，乡下有风也有雨，有寂寞的寒冬，也有漫长而火热的盛夏，草能忍受，庄稼也不惧怕——脚下一样是贫瘠或者丰腴的土地，头上是或阴或暗的天，生长时不妨昂首向天，成熟时不妨低头看地。这日子，悠悠远远，不也已经走了很多年？</p>
<p>  凝望炊烟，静听流年。</p>
<p>  人这一辈子啊，还真是有些复杂,不能像一棵庄稼，在野地里生长。像蚂蚁那样日日辛劳，不过是为了寻找一个遮风避雨的处所。村子就是一个蚂蚁窝，一个个老去的蚂蚁靠在土墙根下晒太阳。他们拿不起锄头了，也背不起草筐，眼看着村口那棵刺槐树上的叶子落了一片又一片，老去的脉络里已寻找不到春天的影像。他们却又无限希望，看着咿咿呀呀在土里打滚的娃儿们笑得合不拢嘴。也许吧，咀嚼了那么些年的庄稼子孙，此时已风化在泥土，紧紧握住一条根，千叮咛万嘱咐，一定不要错过时光，记得在春天上路。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼就是一种温暖——但不一定就是粮食。十月的棉田迎来了收获云的季节，那些丝丝绒绒的棉絮，将被村庄里勤劳的妇女采收在贴身的布兜，在一个个寂寞的夜里，嘤嘤，嘤嘤，纺织着平凡的一生。那些棉的温度，从此将披在男人身上，暖在男人的脚上，甚至，远在千里的儿女，从邮局的包裹里，轻轻，轻轻，取出，一种暖意会霎时夺眶而出。远在天涯的你，是否也在牵挂这样一种温暖，那细密的针脚，就是一个母亲用尽一生写满的爱的叮咛。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼长啊长，分明在汲取天地日月的精华。有一种庄稼叫谷子，细细的茎，狭长的叶子，于夏日的某天，被一粒粒点进田里。阳光有多热烈，生命就有多少激情，他们扎根，分蘖，像风一样顶着七月的流火往上蹿。</p>
<p>  静止，就是静美。这是在秋天，才能体悟到的一种美丽情愫。满地的谷子啊，穗头，比麦子大了好几倍，齐刷刷低下谦卑的头颅。稻草人适时登场，这个陪伴了土地与乡村多少年的神秘人物，就像一尊神的雕像。或者，凝视了乡村很久，像一位普渡众生的圣母，轻轻一拂，谷子便在这个季节迅速膨胀，给贫瘠的家园以最大的希望，让男儿如山，让女儿如花，继续奔跑在乡村或乡村以外的岁月。</p>
<p>  学做一棵庄稼不容易。</p>
<p>  七奶放下手中的镰刀，向远处张望。她在等谁呢？哪怕一阵风能捎来马儿的消息也好。马儿是七奶的长子，七奶一天念叨一百遍也不觉得唠叨，这样，七奶在乡下寂寞的夜里再不会哭泣。</p>
<p>  马儿嘬加鸡蛋红糖的小米粥长大，长大了的马儿是一条骏逸的小马驹。马儿上学了。马儿落榜了。马儿在家门口不怕风吹雨打太阳晒，蚊子咬了浑身红疙瘩，也不肯放弃学习。马儿参军了。马儿考上了军医大学。马儿娶妻了。马儿提干了……马儿却很少再回家。到后来，村里人再也没见过马儿的踪影。</p>
<p>  木匠六爷说了：人啊，咋还不如一棵庄稼。</p>
<p>  人呐，有时候真的不如一棵庄稼。一棵庄稼离村庄很近，见风就长，绝不辜负乡下母亲期盼的眼神。纺成丝线，不是为了牵绊，是为了寄托一种远在天涯的温暖；熬一碗热粥，不是为了挽留，是为了把积攒一生的祝福装进儿女的兜。想念时，哪怕是梦呓也会叫出最亲最暖的那个字——娘。</p>
<p>  玉米又长起来了，蝉的歌唱得无比嘹亮，村庄在仲夏的氤氲里安详。人还是村子里的人，唤狗的唤狗，撵鸡的撵鸡，把日子过得琐琐碎碎，细细长长。一棵庄稼在田野里，听风，听雨，听蟋蟀柔柔的丝弦，明明知道人其实高不过一棵庄稼，也不炫耀所谓的丰功伟绩。</p>
<p>  其实，人知道就好。知道了一棵庄稼的高度，才能仔细审视脚下的土地，无论走多远，不忘却，不迷惘，就会像一棵庄稼，明晰自己的方向。哪怕最后化身为土，也会在来生茁壮。</p>

    <title>智能传感与万物互联的意义</title>
    <url>/2023/09/12/%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%A0%E6%84%9F%E4%B8%8E%E4%B8%87%E7%89%A9%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%9A%84%E6%84%8F%E4%B9%89/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>当代科技快速发展，物联网是将物理世界与数字世界融合的重要一步，它代表着人类社会进入了一个全新的时代，即物联网时代。物联网是基于物的网络，信息可以由任何时间、任何地点的任何人或物产生，智能传感与万物互联之意义重大，深刻影响社会发展。</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>传感技术是物联网的关键技术之一，决定其感知层的构成。国内目前传感器应用占比最多的是工业和汽车领域，发展最快的是汽车电子和通信电子应用市场。此外，在智能农业、智能交通、智能楼宇、智能环保、智能电网、健康医疗、智能穿戴等领域，传感器同样有着广阔的应用空间。</p>
<p>传感与IOT提供了全面的信息收集和数据汇聚能力。通过在物体上植入各种微型感应芯片使其智能化, 然后借助无线网络, 实现人和物“对话”, 物和物“交流”。物联网为我们展示了生活中任何物品都可以变得“有感觉、有思想”这样一幅智能图景, 被认为是世界下一次信息技术浪潮和新经济的引擎。物联网可以实时感知和收集来自物体的大量数据，并将这些数据传递给云端进行处理和分析。对于科学研究、产业发展和社会管理等方面，这种全面信息的提供具有重要的意义。</p>
<p>IOT提升了生产力和效率。IOT赋能智能制造引领转型升级，各类物体通过传感器与互联网连接起来，实现智能化和自动化的交互。比如，智能家居系统可以通过传感器获取用户的家庭习惯和需求，根据这些信息实现自动化的温度控制、照明管理等功能。智能工厂可以通过传感器实时监测生产设备的工作状态，从而实现生产的精益化和智能化。这种提升生产力和效率的能力可以大大推动社会经济的发展，并为人们的生活带来更多便利和舒适。</p>
<p>此外，IOT促进了创新和产业发展。物联网的发展为各行各业的创新提供了广阔的平台。传感技术的应用使得传统物体得以与互联网连接，创造出更多的智能化应用和服务。例如，智能医疗可以通过传感技术实现对患者身体状况的实时监测，提供远程医疗服务；智能交通可以通过车联网技术实现道路交通的智能化管理和优化等。这种创新和产业发展的能力为社会经济的转型和升级提供了新的机遇。<br>从国家层面看，基于工业化与信息化融合战略，政府大力推进物联网技术向传统行业中的深度渗透，使得传感器成为提升我国现代信息技术、带动产业化发展的最好突破口；从技术层面看，承担着数据采集和传输重任的传感器，通过物联网领域的引导，正在朝着智能化、微型化、集成化、网络化、多功能、低功耗的方向发展。</p>
<p>综上，智能传感与IOT提供全面信息的收集和数据汇聚能力，提升生产力和效率，促进创新和产业发展，为我们的社会带来了巨大的变革和机遇。然而，核心制造技术严重滞后于国外，人才资源匮乏，产业发展不足统筹规划不足，投资力度不够等等使我国目前传感器与IOT发展面临困难，这需要不断的技术创新和社会治理的努力来解决，最终促成建设和谐、繁荣、可持续的社会。</p>
