<h2 id="Main-idea"><a href="#Main-idea" class="headerlink" title="Main idea:"></a>Main idea:</h2><p>The first chapter mainly describes the subtle relationship between two people. Julie falls in love with the protagonist Bryce. Unfortunately, Bryce believes that Julie’s enthusiasm is a troublesome behavior. Bryce’s mother did not sympathize with her son because she even wanted him to make friends with Julie. In addition, Bryce’s sister has been helping Julie find Bryce, and she has been bullying Bryce. All of this makes his escaping plan difficult. Bryce has his father as a helper.His father doesn’t like Juli because she is  domineering and dressed in mud. Even though Bryce avoided Julie through a series of things such as searching for her enemies, they ultimately failed, and even worse, their seats at school were too close.<br>However, in fifth and sixth grade, their relationship became more delicate .Julie enjoyed spending time with Bryce, especially smelling his hair. Bryce relied heavily on Julie for homework.Although it’s painful to be in front of Julie，however, he didn’t expect Julie to pass on the answer to him by sniffing his hair, which could be seen as a wonderful ‘collaboration’!</p>
<h2 id="My-reflection"><a href="#My-reflection" class="headerlink" title="My reflection:"></a>My reflection:</h2><p> The author excels in describing characters through action chains, and her portrayal of Bryce and Bryce’s inner entanglement is truly amazing! The subtle relationship between the two is very comical, but the author leaves a suspense. Can Bryce get rid of the annoying Julie by entering middle school?</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Flipped-TEXT"><a href="#Flipped-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="Flipped [TEXT]"></a>Flipped [TEXT]</h2><p>The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped. Honestly, one look at him and I became a lunatic. It’s his eyes. Something in his eyes. They’re blue, and framed in the blackness of his lashes, they’re dazzling. Absolutely breathtaking.</p>
<p>It’s been over six years now, and I learned long ago to hide my feelings, but oh, those first days. Those first years! I thought I would die for wanting to be with him.</p>
<p>Two days before the second grade is when it started, although the anticipation began weeks before—ever since my mother had told me that there was a family with a boy my age moving into the new house right across the street.</p>
<p>Soccer camp had ended, and I’d been so bored because there was nobody, absolutely nobody, in the neighborhood to play with. Oh, there were kids, but every one of them was older. That was dandy for my brothers, but what it left me was home alone.</p>
<p>My mother was there, but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around. So she said, anyway. At the time I didn’t think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around, especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming, but my mother didn’t agree. And the danger of being home alone with her was that she’d recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum, and she wouldn’t tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as I moved from chore to chore.</p>
<p>To play it safe, I waited outside for weeks, just in case the new neighbors moved in early. Literally, it was weeks. I entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog, Champ. Mostly he’d just block because a dog can’t exactly kick and score, but once in a while he’d dribble with his nose. The scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog, though, because Champ would eventually try to chomp it, then lose the ball to me.</p>
<p>When the Loskis’ moving van finally arrived, everyone in my family was happy. “Little Julianna” was finally going to have a playmate.</p>
<p>My mother, being the truly sensible adult that she is, made me wait more than an hour before going over to meet him. “Give them a chance to stretch their legs, Julianna,” she said. “They’ll want some time to adjust.” She wouldn’t even let me watch from the yard. “I know you, sweetheart. Somehow that ball will wind up in their yard and you’ll just have to go retrieve it.”</p>
<p>So I watched from the window, and every few minutes I’d ask, “Now?” and she’d say, “Give them a little while longer, would you?”</p>
<p>Then the phone rang. And the minute I was sure she was good and preoccupied, I tugged on her sleeve and asked, “Now?”</p>
<p>She nodded and whispered, “Okay, but take it easy! I’ll be over there in a minute.”</p>
<p>I was too excited not to charge across the street, but I did try very hard to be civilized once I got to the moving van. I stood outside looking in for a record-breaking length of time, which was hard because there he was! About halfway back! My new sure-to-be best friend, Bryce Loski.</p>
<p>Bryce wasn’t really doing much of anything. He was more hanging back, watching his father move boxes onto the lift-gate. I remember feeling sorry for Mr. Loski because he looked worn out, moving boxes all by himself. I also remember that he and Bryce were wearing matching turquoise polo shirts, which I thought was really cute. Really nice.</p>
<p>When I couldn’t stand it any longer, I called, “Hi!” into the van, which made Bryce jump, and then quick as a cricket, he started pushing a box like he’d been working all along.</p>
<p>I could tell from the way Bryce was acting so guilty that he was supposed to be moving boxes, but he was sick of it. He’d probably been moving things for days! It was easy to see that he needed a rest. He needed some juice! Something.</p>
<p>It was also easy to see that Mr. Loski wasn’t about to let him quit. He was going to keep on moving boxes around until he collapsed, and by then Bryce might be dead. Dead before he’d had the chance to move in!</p>
<p>The tragedy of it catapulted me into the moving van. I had to help! I had to save him!</p>
<p>When I got to his side to help him shove a box forward, the poor boy was so exhausted that he just moved aside and let me take over. Mr. Loski didn’t want me to help, but at least I saved Bryce. I’d been in the moving van all of three minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mother unpack things inside the house.</p>
<p>I chased Bryce up the walkway, and that’s when everything changed. You see, I caught up to him and grabbed his arm, trying to stop him so maybe we could play a little before he got trapped inside, and the next thing I know he’s holding my hand, looking right into my eyes.</p>
<p>My heart stopped. It just stopped beating. And for the first time in my life, I had that feeling. You know, like the world is moving all around you, all beneath you, all inside you, and you’re floating. Floating in midair. And the only thing keeping you from drifting away is the other person’s eyes. They’re connected to yours by some invisible physical force, and they hold you fast while the rest of the world swirls and twirls and falls completely away.</p>
<p>I almost got my first kiss that day. I’m sure of it. But then his mother came out the front door and he was so embarrassed that his cheeks turned completely red, and the next thing you know he’s hiding in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I was waiting for him to come out when his sister, Lynetta, saw me in the hallway. She seemed big and mature to me, and since she wanted to know what was going on, I told her a little bit about it. I shouldn’t have, though, because she wiggled the bathroom doorknob and started teasing Bryce something fierce. “Hey, baby brother!” she called through the door. “There’s a hot chick out here waiting for you! Whatsa matter? Afraid she’s got cooties?”</p>
<p>It was so embarrassing! I yanked on her arm and told her to stop it, but she wouldn’t, so finally I just left.</p>
<p>I found my mother outside talking to Mrs. Loski. Mom had given her the beautiful lemon Bundt cake that was supposed to be our dessert that night. The powdered sugar looked soft and white, and the cake was still warm, sending sweet lemon smells into the air.</p>
<p>My mouth was watering just looking at it! But it was in Mrs. Loski’s hands, and I knew there was no getting it back. All I could do was try to eat up the smells while I listened to the two of them discuss grocery stores and the weather forecast.</p>
<p>After that Mom and I went home. It was very strange. I hadn’t gotten to play with Bryce at all. All I knew was that his eyes were a dizzying blue, that he had a sister who was not to be trusted, and that he’d almost kissed me.</p>
<p>I fell asleep that night thinking about the kiss that might have been. What did a kiss feel like, anyway? Somehow I knew it wouldn’t be like the one I got from Mom or Dad at bedtime. The same species, maybe, but a radically different beast, to be sure. Like a wolf and a whippet—only science would put them on the same tree.</p>
<p>Looking back on the second grade, I like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss, but to be honest, it was probably more those blue eyes. All through the second and third grades I couldn’t seem to stop myself from following him, from sitting by him, from just wanting to be near him.</p>
<p>By the fourth grade I’d learned to control myself. The sight of him—the thought of him—still sent my heart humming, but my legs didn’t actually chase after him anymore. I just watched and thought and dreamed.</p>
<p>Then in the fifth grade Shelly Stalls came into the picture. Shelly Stalls is a ninny. A whiny, gossipy, backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another. Now that we’re in junior high, she’s the undisputed diva of drama, but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance. Especially when it came to P.E. I never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics. Instead, she would go into her “delicate” act, claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched.</p>
<p>It worked. Every year. She’d bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year, after which she’d be excused from anything that required muscles. She never even put up her own chair at the end of the day. The only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth, and those she worked out nonstop. If there was an Olympic contest for talking, Shelly Stalls would sweep the event. Well, she’d at least win the gold and silver— one medal for each side of her mouth.</p>
<p>What bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of P.E.—who’d want her on their team, anyway? What bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasn’t asthma or weak ankles or her being “delicate” that was stopping her. It was her hair. She had mountains of it, twisted this way or that, clipped or beaded, braided or swirled. Her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses. And on the days she let it all hang down, she’d sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket, so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose. Good luck playing four-square with a blanket over your head.</p>
<p>My solution to Shelly Stalls was to ignore her, which worked just dandy until about halfway through the fifth grade when I saw her holding hands with Bryce.</p>
<p>My Bryce. The one who was still embarrassed over holding my hand two days before the second grade. The one who was still too shy to say much more than hello to me.</p>
<p>The one who was still walking around with my first kiss.</p>
<p>How could Shelly have wormed her hand into his? That pushy little princess had no business hanging on to him like that!</p>
<p>Bryce looked over his shoulder from time to time as they walked along, and he was looking at me. My first thought was that he was telling me he was sorry. Then it dawned on me— he needed my help. Absolutely, that’s what it had to be! Shelly Stalls was too delicate to shake off, too swirly to be pushed away. She’d unravel and start sniffling and oh, how embarrassing that would be for him! No, this wasn’t a job a boy could do gracefully. This was a job for a girl.</p>
<p>I didn’t even bother checking around for other candidates—I had her off of him in two seconds flat. Bryce ran away the minute he was free, but not Shelly. Oh, no-no-no! She came at me, scratching and pulling and twisting anything she could get her hands on, telling me that Bryce was hers and there was no way she was letting him go.</p>
<p>How delicate.</p>
<p>I was hoping for herds of teachers to appear so they could see the real Shelly Stalls in action, but it was too late by the time anyone arrived on the scene. I had Fluffy in a headlock and her arm twisted back in a hammerlock, and no amount of her squawking or scratching was going to get me to un lock her until a teacher arrived.</p>
<p>In the end, Shelly went home early with a bad case of mussed-up hair, while I told my side of things to the principal. Mrs. Shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed, and although she told me that it would be better if I let other people work out their own dilemmas, she definitely understood about Shelly Stalls and her hair and told me she was glad I’d had the self-control to do nothing more than restrain her.</p>
<p>Shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids. And of course she got everybody whispering about me, but I just ignored them. The facts spoke for themselves. Bryce didn’t go anywhere near her for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Bryce held my hand after that, but he did start being a little friendlier to me. Especially in the sixth grade, after Mr. Mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Bryce was nice. He was nice. He’d say Hi, Juli to me every morning, and once in a while I’d catch him looking my way. He’d always blush and go back to his own work, and I couldn’t help but smile. He was so shy. And so cute!</p>
<p>We talked to each other more, too. Especially after Mr. Mertins moved me behind him. Mr. Mertins had a detention policy about spelling, where if you missed more than seven out of twenty-five words, you had to spend lunch inside with him, writing your words over and over and over again.</p>
<p>The pressure of detention made Bryce panic. And even though it bothered my conscience, I’d lean in and whisper answers to him, hoping that maybe I could spend lunch with him instead. His hair smelled like watermelon, and his ear-lobes had fuzz. Soft, blond fuzz. And I wondered about that. How does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz? What’s it doing there, anyway? I checked my own ear-lobes in the mirror but couldn’t find much of anything on them, and I didn’t spot any on other people’s either.</p>
<p>I thought about asking Mr. Mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science, but I didn’t. Instead, I spent the year whispering spelling words, sniffing watermelon, and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.</p>

    <title>人其实高不过一棵庄稼</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>作者:宋长征<br>  人住在村子里，养鸡，喂狗，用铡刀铡碎一捆青草，是为了一头牛青青黄黄的日子。鸡会打鸣，会下蛋，会在村前的小河滩上领着一帮子女逮蚂蚱。人也想，可是脱不开身呀，村外的田里种着庄稼，村子里整天发生着大大小小的事情。所以，人想活成一只鸡都不成；再说，鸡的下场也不怎么光荣。狗最会看家，看似卧在墙根下，眯缝着眼，稍有动静，就红了眼，把一个“汪”字重复喊了很多遍。其实，见你一哈腰，便弓了身子，夹起尾巴，钻进一个柴草窠里，再不愿管别人的闲事。人不像狗，要不然，活得多没意义。</p>
<p>  牛呢，我不说你也知道。主人下地了，被拴在林东的一棵歪脖子柳树上，日头在东，在西边卧；日头爬上南天门，就靠紧了柳树根。嘴倒嚼着，尾巴甩来甩去，也拍不到一只苍蝇；日头落在屋檐上的时候，牛们大都站起身来，朝着庄稼地的方向，哞——哞——喊了两嗓子，不大会儿就有人走了过来。天就黑了。</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>  庄稼住在地里。南岗子，西水洼，起起伏伏，不咋平坦的老河滩上都是庄稼的家。眼下，庄稼做不了自己的主，村子里住的有的是人。别看平常不怎么出来，开春了，动镰了，一个个像从战壕里跃出来的士兵，跟无形的时光拼着抢着，不过是为了果腹，重复上演着祖先继续了很多年的战争。庄稼一开始不大理会这个，好像有了人，日子便再不会像草那么索然无趣。老河滩上的草就没人管，发芽了，开花了，结果了。羊呢，比较挑嘴，喜欢的，抿在嘴里，不紧不慢，咀嚼着光阴；不喜欢的，比如刺老牙，打了个响鼻，分明在告诉自己的子女：那玩意儿碰不得。</p>
<p>  至于庄稼到底羡不羡慕草的活法，这个你得问庄稼。反正，乡下有风也有雨，有寂寞的寒冬，也有漫长而火热的盛夏，草能忍受，庄稼也不惧怕——脚下一样是贫瘠或者丰腴的土地，头上是或阴或暗的天，生长时不妨昂首向天，成熟时不妨低头看地。这日子，悠悠远远，不也已经走了很多年？</p>
<p>  凝望炊烟，静听流年。</p>
<p>  人这一辈子啊，还真是有些复杂,不能像一棵庄稼，在野地里生长。像蚂蚁那样日日辛劳，不过是为了寻找一个遮风避雨的处所。村子就是一个蚂蚁窝，一个个老去的蚂蚁靠在土墙根下晒太阳。他们拿不起锄头了，也背不起草筐，眼看着村口那棵刺槐树上的叶子落了一片又一片，老去的脉络里已寻找不到春天的影像。他们却又无限希望，看着咿咿呀呀在土里打滚的娃儿们笑得合不拢嘴。也许吧，咀嚼了那么些年的庄稼子孙，此时已风化在泥土，紧紧握住一条根，千叮咛万嘱咐，一定不要错过时光，记得在春天上路。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼就是一种温暖——但不一定就是粮食。十月的棉田迎来了收获云的季节，那些丝丝绒绒的棉絮，将被村庄里勤劳的妇女采收在贴身的布兜，在一个个寂寞的夜里，嘤嘤，嘤嘤，纺织着平凡的一生。那些棉的温度，从此将披在男人身上，暖在男人的脚上，甚至，远在千里的儿女，从邮局的包裹里，轻轻，轻轻，取出，一种暖意会霎时夺眶而出。远在天涯的你，是否也在牵挂这样一种温暖，那细密的针脚，就是一个母亲用尽一生写满的爱的叮咛。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼长啊长，分明在汲取天地日月的精华。有一种庄稼叫谷子，细细的茎，狭长的叶子，于夏日的某天，被一粒粒点进田里。阳光有多热烈，生命就有多少激情，他们扎根，分蘖，像风一样顶着七月的流火往上蹿。</p>
<p>  静止，就是静美。这是在秋天，才能体悟到的一种美丽情愫。满地的谷子啊，穗头，比麦子大了好几倍，齐刷刷低下谦卑的头颅。稻草人适时登场，这个陪伴了土地与乡村多少年的神秘人物，就像一尊神的雕像。或者，凝视了乡村很久，像一位普渡众生的圣母，轻轻一拂，谷子便在这个季节迅速膨胀，给贫瘠的家园以最大的希望，让男儿如山，让女儿如花，继续奔跑在乡村或乡村以外的岁月。</p>
<p>  学做一棵庄稼不容易。</p>
<p>  七奶放下手中的镰刀，向远处张望。她在等谁呢？哪怕一阵风能捎来马儿的消息也好。马儿是七奶的长子，七奶一天念叨一百遍也不觉得唠叨，这样，七奶在乡下寂寞的夜里再不会哭泣。</p>
<p>  马儿嘬加鸡蛋红糖的小米粥长大，长大了的马儿是一条骏逸的小马驹。马儿上学了。马儿落榜了。马儿在家门口不怕风吹雨打太阳晒，蚊子咬了浑身红疙瘩，也不肯放弃学习。马儿参军了。马儿考上了军医大学。马儿娶妻了。马儿提干了……马儿却很少再回家。到后来，村里人再也没见过马儿的踪影。</p>
<p>  木匠六爷说了：人啊，咋还不如一棵庄稼。</p>
<p>  人呐，有时候真的不如一棵庄稼。一棵庄稼离村庄很近，见风就长，绝不辜负乡下母亲期盼的眼神。纺成丝线，不是为了牵绊，是为了寄托一种远在天涯的温暖；熬一碗热粥，不是为了挽留，是为了把积攒一生的祝福装进儿女的兜。想念时，哪怕是梦呓也会叫出最亲最暖的那个字——娘。</p>
<p>  玉米又长起来了，蝉的歌唱得无比嘹亮，村庄在仲夏的氤氲里安详。人还是村子里的人，唤狗的唤狗，撵鸡的撵鸡，把日子过得琐琐碎碎，细细长长。一棵庄稼在田野里，听风，听雨，听蟋蟀柔柔的丝弦，明明知道人其实高不过一棵庄稼，也不炫耀所谓的丰功伟绩。</p>
<p>  其实，人知道就好。知道了一棵庄稼的高度，才能仔细审视脚下的土地，无论走多远，不忘却，不迷惘，就会像一棵庄稼，明晰自己的方向。哪怕最后化身为土，也会在来生茁壮。</p>
