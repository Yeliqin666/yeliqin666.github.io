    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Buddy-Beware"><a href="#Buddy-Beware" class="headerlink" title="Buddy, Beware!"></a>Buddy, Beware!</h2><p>Seventh grade brought changes, all right, but the biggest one didn’t happen at school — it happened at home. Granddad Duncan came to live with us.</p>
<p>At first it was kind of weird because none of us really knew him. Except for Mom, of course. And even though she’s spent the past year and a half trying to convince us he’s a great guy, from what I can tell, the thing he likes to do best is stare out the front-room window. There’s not much to see out there except the Bakers’ front yard, but you can find him there day or night, sitting in the big easy chair they moved in with him, staring out the window.</p>
<p>Okay, so he also reads Tom Clancy novels and the newspapers and does crossword puzzles and tracks his stocks, but those things are all distractions. Given no one to justify it to, the man would stare out the window until he fell asleep. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It just seems so … boring.</p>
<p>Mom says he stares like that because he misses Grandma, but that’s not something Granddad had ever discussed with me. As a matter of fact, he never discussed much of anything with me until a few months ago when he read about Juli in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Now, Juli Baker did not wind up on the front page of the Mayfield Times for being an eighth-grade Einstein, like you might suspect. No, my friend, she got front-page coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.</p>
<p>Not that I could tell a sycamore from a maple or a birch for that matter, but Juli, of course, knew what kind of tree it was and passed that knowledge along to every creature in her wake.</p>
<p>So this tree, this sycamore tree, was up the hill on a vacant lot on Collier Street, and it was massive. Massive and ugly. It was twisted and gnarled and bent, and I kept expecting the thing to blow over in the wind.</p>
<p>One day last year I’d finally had enough of her yakking about that stupid tree. I came right out and told her that it was not a magnificent sycamore, it was, in reality, the ugliest tree known to man. And you know what she said? She said I was visually challenged. Visually challenged! This from the girl who lives in a house that’s the scourge of the neighborhood. They’ve got bushes growing over windows, weeds sticking out all over the place, and a barnyard’s worth of animals running wild. I’m talking dogs, cats, chickens, even snakes. I swear to God, her brothers have a boa constrictor in their room. They dragged me in there when I was about ten and made me watch it eat a rat. A live, beady-eyed rat. They held that rodent up by its tail and gulp, the boa swallowed it whole. That snake gave me nightmares for a month.</p>
<p>Anyway, normally I wouldn’t care about someone’s yard, but the Bakers’ mess bugged my dad big-time, and he channeled his frustration into our yard. He said it was our neighborly duty to show them what a yard’s supposed to look like. So while Mike and Matt are busy plumping up their boa, I’m having to mow and edge our yard, then sweep the walkways and gutter, which is going a little overboard, if you ask me.</p>
<p>And you’d think Juli’s dad—who’s a big, strong, bricklaying dude — would fix the place up, but no. According to my mom, he spends all his free time painting. His landscapes don’t seem like anything special to me, but judging by his price tags, he thinks quite a lot of them. We see them every year at the Mayfield County Fair, and my parents always say the same thing: “The world would have more beauty in it if he’d fix up the yard instead.”</p>
<p>Mom and Juli’s mom do talk some. I think my mom feels sorry for Mrs. Baker — she says she married a dreamer, and because of that, one of the two of them will always be unhappy.</p>
<p>Whatever. Maybe Juli’s aesthetic sensibilities have been permanently screwed up by her father and none of this is her fault, but Juli has always thought that that sycamore tree was God’s gift to our little corner of the universe.</p>
<p>Back in the third and fourth grades she used to clown around with her brothers in the branches or peel big chunks of bark off so they could slide down the crook in its trunk. It seemed like they were playing in it whenever my mom took us somewhere in the car. Juli’d be swinging from the branches, ready to fall and break every bone in her body, while we were waiting at the stoplight, and my mom would shake her head and say, “Don’t you ever climb that tree like that, do you hear me, Bryce? I never want to see you doing that! You either, Lynetta. That is much too dangerous.”</p>
<p>My sister would roll her eyes and say, “As if,” while I’d slump beneath the window and pray for the light to change before Juli squealed my name for the world to hear.</p>
<p>I did try to climb it once in the fifth grade. It was the day after Juli had rescued my kite from its mutant toy-eating foliage. She climbed miles up to get my kite, and when she came down, she was actually very cool about it. She didn’t hold my kite hostage and stick her lips out like I was afraid she might. She just handed it over and then backed away.</p>
<p>I was relieved, but I also felt like a weenie. When I’d seen where my kite was trapped, I was sure it was a goner. Not Juli. She scrambled up and got it down in no time. Man, it was embarrassing.</p>
<p>So I made a mental picture of how high she’d climbed, and the next day I set off to outdo her by at least two branches. I made it past the crook, up a few limbs, and then — just to see how I was doing — I looked down.</p>
<p>Mis-take! It felt like I was on top of the Empire State Building without a bungee. I tried looking up to where my kite had been, but it was hopeless. I was indeed a tree-climbing weenie.</p>
<p>Then junior high started and my dream of a Juli-free existence shattered. I had to take the bus, and you-know-who did, too. There were about eight kids altogether at our bus stop, which created a buffer zone, but it was no comfort zone. Juli always tried to stand beside me, or talk to me, or in some other way mortify me.</p>
<p>And then she started climbing. The girl is in the seventh grade, and she’s climbing a tree — way, way up in a tree. And why does she do it? So she can yell down at us that the bus is five! four! three blocks away! Blow-by-blow traffic watch from a tree — what every kid in junior high feels like hearing first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>She tried to get me to come up there with her, too. “Bryce, come on! You won’t believe the colors! It’s absolutely magnificent! Bryce, you’ve got to come up here!”</p>
<p>Yeah, I could just hear it: “Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree…” Was I ever going to leave the second grade behind?</p>
<p>One morning I was specifically not looking up when out of nowhere she swings down from a branch and practically knocks me over. Heart a-ttack! I dropped my backpack and wrenched my neck, and that did it. I refused to wait under that tree with that maniac monkey on the loose anymore. I started leaving the house at the very last minute. I made up my own waiting spot, and when I’d see the bus pull up, I’d truck up the hill and get on board.</p>
<p>No Juli, no problem.</p>
<p>And that, my friend, took care of the rest of seventh grade and almost all of eighth, too, until one day a few months ago. That’s when I heard a commotion up the hill and could see some big trucks parked up on Collier Street where the bus pulls in. There were some men shouting stuff up at Juli, who was, of course, five stories up in the tree.</p>
<p>All the other kids started to gather under the tree, too, and I could hear them telling her she had to come down. She was fine — that was obvious to anyone with a pair of ears — but I couldn’t figure out what they were all arguing about.</p>
<p>I trucked up the hill, and as I got closer and saw what the men were holding, I figured out in a hurry what was making Juli refuse to come out of the tree.</p>
<p>Chain saws.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong here, okay? The tree was an ugly mutant tangle of gnarly branches. The girl arguing with those men was Juli — the world’s peskiest, bossiest, most know-it-all female. But all of a sudden my stomach completely bailed on me. Juli loved that tree. Stupid as it was, she loved that tree, and cutting it down would be like cutting out her heart.</p>
<p>Everyone tried to talk her down. Even me. But she said she wasn’t coming down, not ever, and then she tried to talk us up. “Bryce, please! Come up here with me. They won’t cut it down if we’re all up here!”</p>
<p>For a second I considered it. But then the bus arrived and I talked myself out of it. It wasn’t my tree, and even though she acted like it was, it wasn’t Juli’s, either.</p>
<p>We boarded the bus and left her behind, but school was pretty much a waste. I couldn’t seem to stop thinking about Juli. Was she still up in the tree? Were they going to arrest her?</p>
<p>When the bus dropped us off that afternoon, Juli was gone and so was half the tree. The top branches, the place my kite had been stuck, her favorite perch — they were all gone.</p>
<p>We watched them work for a little while, the chain saws gunning at full throttle, smoking as they chewed through wood. The tree looked lopsided and naked, and after a few minutes I had to get out of there. It was like watching someone dismember a body, and for the first time in ages, I felt like crying. Crying. Over a stupid tree that I hated.</p>
<p>I went home and tried to shake it off, but I kept wondering, Should I have gone up the tree with her? Would it have done any good?</p>
<p>I thought about calling Juli to tell her I was sorry they’d cut it down, but I didn’t. It would’ve been too, I don’t know, weird.</p>
<p>She didn’t show at the bus stop the next morning and didn’t ride the bus home that afternoon, either.</p>
<p>Then that night, right before dinner, my grandfather summoned me into the front room. He didn’t call to me as I was walking by — that would have bordered on friendliness. What he did was talk to my mother, who talked to me. “I don’t know what it’s about, honey,” she said. “Maybe he’s just ready to get to know you a little better.”</p>
<p>Great. The man’s had a year and a half to get acquainted, and he chooses now to get to know me. But I couldn’t exactly blow him off.</p>
<p>My grandfather’s a big man with a meaty nose and greased-back salt-and-pepper hair. He lives in house slippers and a sports coat, and I’ve never seen a whisker on him. They grow, but he shaves them off like three times a day. It’s a real recreational activity for him.</p>
<p>Besides his meaty nose, he’s also got big meaty hands. I suppose you’d notice his hands regardless, but what makes you realize just how beefy they are is his wedding ring. That thing’s never going to come off, and even though my mother says that’s how it should be, I think he ought to get it cut off. Another few pounds and that ring’s going to amputate his finger.</p>
<p>When I went in to see him, those big hands of his were woven together, resting on the newspaper in his lap. I said, “Granddad? You wanted to see me?”</p>
<p>“Have a seat, son.”</p>
<p>Son? Half the time he didn’t seem to know who I was, and now suddenly I was “son”? I sat in the chair opposite him and waited.</p>
<p>“Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.”</p>
<p>“Juli? She’s not exactly my friend … !”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” he asked. Calmly. Like he had prior knowledge.</p>
<p>I started to justify it, then stopped myself and asked, “Why do you want to know?”</p>
<p>He opened the paper and pressed down the crease, and that’s when I realized that Juli Baker had made the front page of the Mayfield Times. There was a huge picture of her in the tree, surrounded by a fire brigade and policemen, and then some smaller photos I couldn’t make out very well. “Can I see that?”</p>
<p>He folded it up but didn’t hand it over. “Why isn’t she your friend, Bryce?”</p>
<p>“Because she’s …” I shook my head and said, “You’d have to know Juli.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the girl’s got an iron backbone. Why don’t you invite her over sometime?”</p>
<p>“An iron backbone? Granddad, you don’t understand! That girl is a royal pain. She’s a show-off, she’s a know-it-all, and she is pushy beyond belief!”</p>
<p>“Is that so.”</p>
<p>“Yes! That’s absolutely so! And she’s been stalking me since the second grade!”</p>
<p>He frowned, then looked out the window and asked, “They’ve lived there that long?”</p>
<p>“I think they were all born there!”</p>
<p>He frowned some more before he looked back at me and said, “A girl like that doesn’t live next door to everyone, you know.”</p>
<p>“Lucky them!”</p>
<p>He studied me, long and hard. I said, “What?” but he didn’t flinch. He just kept staring at me, and I couldn’t take it — I had to look away.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this was the first real conversation I’d had with my grandfather. This was the first time he’d made the effort to talk to me about something besides passing the salt. And does he want to get to know me? No! He wants to know about Juli!</p>
<p>I couldn’t just stand up and leave, even though that’s what I felt like doing. Somehow I knew if I left like that, he’d quit talking to me at all. Even about salt. So I sat there feeling sort of tortured. Was he mad at me? How could he be mad at me? I hadn’t done anything wrong!</p>
<p>When I looked up, he was sitting there holding out the newspaper to me. “Read this,” he said. “Without prejudice.”</p>
<p>I took it, and when he went back to looking out the window, I knew — I’d been dismissed.</p>
<p>By the time I got down to my room, I was mad. I slammed my bedroom door and flopped down on the bed, and after fuming about my sorry excuse for a grandfather for a while, I shoved the newspaper in the bottom drawer of my desk. Like I needed to know any more about Juli Baker.</p>
<p>At dinner my mother asked me why I was so sulky, and she kept looking from me to my grandfather. Granddad didn’t seem to need any salt, which was a good thing because I might have thrown the shaker at him.</p>
<p>My sister and dad were all business as usual, though. Lynetta ate about two raisins out of her carrot salad, then peeled the skin and meat off her chicken wing and nibbled gristle off the bone, while my father filled up airspace talking about office politics and the need for a shakedown in upper management.</p>
<p>No one was listening to him — no one ever does when he gets on one of his if-I-ran-the-circus jags — but for once Mom wasn’t even pretending. And for once she wasn’t trying to convince Lynetta that dinner was delicious either. She just kept eyeing me and Granddad, trying to pick up on why we were miffed at each other.</p>
<p>Not that he had anything to be miffed at me about. What had I done to him, anyway? Nothing. Nada. But he was, I could tell. And I completely avoided looking at him until about halfway through dinner, when I sneaked a peek.</p>
<p>He was studying me, all right. And even though it wasn’t a mean stare, or a hard stare, it was, you know, firm. Steady. And it weirded me out. What was his deal?</p>
<p>I didn’t look at him again. Or at my mother. I just went back to eating and pretended to listen to my dad. And the first chance I got, I excused myself and holed up in my room.</p>
<p>I was planning to call my friend Garrett like I usually do when I’m bent about something. I even punched in his number, but I don’t know. I just hung up.</p>
<p>And later when my mom came in, I faked like I was sleeping. I haven’t done that in years. The whole night was weird like that. I just wanted to be left alone.</p>
<p>Juli wasn’t at the bus stop the next morning. Or Friday morning. She was at school, but you’d never know it if you didn’t actually look. She didn’t whip her hand through the air trying to get the teacher to call on her or charge through the halls getting to class. She didn’t make unsolicited comments for the teacher’s edification or challenge the kids who took cuts in the milk line. She just sat. Quiet.</p>
<p>I told myself I should be glad about it — it was like she wasn’t even there, and isn’t that what I’d always wanted? But still, I felt bad. About her tree, about how she hurried off to eat by herself in the library at lunch, about how her eyes were red around the edges. I wanted to tell her, Man, I’m sorry about your sycamore tree, but the words never seemed to come out.</p>
<p>By the middle of the next week, they’d finished taking down the tree. They cleared the lot and even tried to pull up the stump, but that sucker would not budge, so they wound up grinding it down into the dirt.</p>
<p>Juli still didn’t show at the bus stop, and by the end of the week I learned from Garrett that she was riding a bike. He said he’d seen her on the side of the road twice that week, putting the chain back on the derailleur of a rusty old ten-speed.</p>
<p>I figured she’d be back. It was a long ride out to Mayfield Junior High, and once she got over the tree, she’d start riding the bus again. I even caught myself looking for her. Not on the lookout, just looking.</p>
<p>Then one day it rained and I thought for sure she’d be up at the bus stop, but no. Garrett said he saw her trucking along on her bike in a bright yellow poncho, and in math I noticed that her pants were still soaked from the knees down.</p>
<p>When math let out, I started to chase after her to tell her that she ought to try riding the bus again, but I stopped myself in the nick of time. What was I thinking? That Juli wouldn’t take a little friendly concern and completely misinterpret it? Whoa now, buddy, beware! Better to just leave well enough alone.</p>
<p>After all, the last thing I needed was for Juli Baker to think I missed her.</p>

Julie falls in love with the protagonist Bryce. Unfortunately, Bryce believes that Julie’s enthusiasm is a troublesome behavior. Bryce’s mother did not sympathize with her son because she even wanted him to make friends with Julie. In addition, Bryce’s sister has been helping Julie find Bryce, and she has been bullying Bryce. All of this makes his escaping plan difficult. Bryce has his father as a helper.His father doesn’t like Juli because she is  domineering and dressed in mud. Even though Bryce avoided Julie through a series of things such as searching for her enemies, they ultimately failed, and even worse, their seats at school were too close.<br>However, in fifth and sixth grade, their relationship became more delicate .Julie enjoyed spending time with Bryce, especially smelling his hair. Bryce relied heavily on Julie for homework.Although it’s painful to be in front of Julie，however, he didn’t expect Julie to pass on the answer to him by sniffing his hair, which could be seen as a wonderful ‘collaboration’!</p>

    <title>Flipped阅读笔记-Chapter2</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Flipped-TEXT"><a href="#Flipped-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="Flipped [TEXT]"></a>Flipped [TEXT]</h2><p>The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped. Honestly, one look at him and I became a lunatic. It’s his eyes. Something in his eyes. They’re blue, and framed in the blackness of his lashes, they’re dazzling. Absolutely breathtaking.</p>
<p>It’s been over six years now, and I learned long ago to hide my feelings, but oh, those first days. Those first years! I thought I would die for wanting to be with him.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Two days before the second grade is when it started, although the anticipation began weeks before—ever since my mother had told me that there was a family with a boy my age moving into the new house right across the street.<br>Soccer camp had ended, and I’d been so bored because there was nobody, absolutely nobody, in the neighborhood to play with. Oh, there were kids, but every one of them was older. That was dandy for my brothers, but what it left me was home alone.</p>
<p>My mother was there, but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around. So she said, anyway. At the time I didn’t think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around, especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming, but my mother didn’t agree. And the danger of being home alone with her was that she’d recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum, and she wouldn’t tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as I moved from chore to chore.</p>
<p>To play it safe, I waited outside for weeks, just in case the new neighbors moved in early. Literally, it was weeks. I entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog, Champ. Mostly he’d just block because a dog can’t exactly kick and score, but once in a while he’d dribble with his nose. The scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog, though, because Champ would eventually try to chomp it, then lose the ball to me.</p>
<p>When the Loskis’ moving van finally arrived, everyone in my family was happy. “Little Julianna” was finally going to have a playmate.</p>
<p>My mother, being the truly sensible adult that she is, made me wait more than an hour before going over to meet him. “Give them a chance to stretch their legs, Julianna,” she said. “They’ll want some time to adjust.” She wouldn’t even let me watch from the yard. “I know you, sweetheart. Somehow that ball will wind up in their yard and you’ll just have to go retrieve it.”</p>
<p>So I watched from the window, and every few minutes I’d ask, “Now?” and she’d say, “Give them a little while longer, would you?”</p>
<p>Then the phone rang. And the minute I was sure she was good and preoccupied, I tugged on her sleeve and asked, “Now?”</p>
<p>She nodded and whispered, “Okay, but take it easy! I’ll be over there in a minute.”</p>
<p>I was too excited not to charge across the street, but I did try very hard to be civilized once I got to the moving van. I stood outside looking in for a record-breaking length of time, which was hard because there he was! About halfway back! My new sure-to-be best friend, Bryce Loski.</p>
<p>Bryce wasn’t really doing much of anything. He was more hanging back, watching his father move boxes onto the lift-gate. I remember feeling sorry for Mr. Loski because he looked worn out, moving boxes all by himself. I also remember that he and Bryce were wearing matching turquoise polo shirts, which I thought was really cute. Really nice.</p>
<p>When I couldn’t stand it any longer, I called, “Hi!” into the van, which made Bryce jump, and then quick as a cricket, he started pushing a box like he’d been working all along.</p>
<p>I could tell from the way Bryce was acting so guilty that he was supposed to be moving boxes, but he was sick of it. He’d probably been moving things for days! It was easy to see that he needed a rest. He needed some juice! Something.</p>
<p>It was also easy to see that Mr. Loski wasn’t about to let him quit. He was going to keep on moving boxes around until he collapsed, and by then Bryce might be dead. Dead before he’d had the chance to move in!</p>
<p>The tragedy of it catapulted me into the moving van. I had to help! I had to save him!</p>
<p>When I got to his side to help him shove a box forward, the poor boy was so exhausted that he just moved aside and let me take over. Mr. Loski didn’t want me to help, but at least I saved Bryce. I’d been in the moving van all of three minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mother unpack things inside the house.</p>
<p>I chased Bryce up the walkway, and that’s when everything changed. You see, I caught up to him and grabbed his arm, trying to stop him so maybe we could play a little before he got trapped inside, and the next thing I know he’s holding my hand, looking right into my eyes.</p>
<p>My heart stopped. It just stopped beating. And for the first time in my life, I had that feeling. You know, like the world is moving all around you, all beneath you, all inside you, and you’re floating. Floating in midair. And the only thing keeping you from drifting away is the other person’s eyes. They’re connected to yours by some invisible physical force, and they hold you fast while the rest of the world swirls and twirls and falls completely away.</p>
<p>I almost got my first kiss that day. I’m sure of it. But then his mother came out the front door and he was so embarrassed that his cheeks turned completely red, and the next thing you know he’s hiding in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I was waiting for him to come out when his sister, Lynetta, saw me in the hallway. She seemed big and mature to me, and since she wanted to know what was going on, I told her a little bit about it. I shouldn’t have, though, because she wiggled the bathroom doorknob and started teasing Bryce something fierce. “Hey, baby brother!” she called through the door. “There’s a hot chick out here waiting for you! Whatsa matter? Afraid she’s got cooties?”</p>
<p>It was so embarrassing! I yanked on her arm and told her to stop it, but she wouldn’t, so finally I just left.</p>
<p>I found my mother outside talking to Mrs. Loski. Mom had given her the beautiful lemon Bundt cake that was supposed to be our dessert that night. The powdered sugar looked soft and white, and the cake was still warm, sending sweet lemon smells into the air.</p>
<p>My mouth was watering just looking at it! But it was in Mrs. Loski’s hands, and I knew there was no getting it back. All I could do was try to eat up the smells while I listened to the two of them discuss grocery stores and the weather forecast.</p>
<p>After that Mom and I went home. It was very strange. I hadn’t gotten to play with Bryce at all. All I knew was that his eyes were a dizzying blue, that he had a sister who was not to be trusted, and that he’d almost kissed me.</p>
<p>I fell asleep that night thinking about the kiss that might have been. What did a kiss feel like, anyway? Somehow I knew it wouldn’t be like the one I got from Mom or Dad at bedtime. The same species, maybe, but a radically different beast, to be sure. Like a wolf and a whippet—only science would put them on the same tree.</p>
<p>Looking back on the second grade, I like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss, but to be honest, it was probably more those blue eyes. All through the second and third grades I couldn’t seem to stop myself from following him, from sitting by him, from just wanting to be near him.</p>
<p>By the fourth grade I’d learned to control myself. The sight of him—the thought of him—still sent my heart humming, but my legs didn’t actually chase after him anymore. I just watched and thought and dreamed.</p>
<p>Then in the fifth grade Shelly Stalls came into the picture. Shelly Stalls is a ninny. A whiny, gossipy, backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another. Now that we’re in junior high, she’s the undisputed diva of drama, but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance. Especially when it came to P.E. I never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics. Instead, she would go into her “delicate” act, claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched.</p>
<p>It worked. Every year. She’d bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year, after which she’d be excused from anything that required muscles. She never even put up her own chair at the end of the day. The only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth, and those she worked out nonstop. If there was an Olympic contest for talking, Shelly Stalls would sweep the event. Well, she’d at least win the gold and silver— one medal for each side of her mouth.</p>
<p>What bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of P.E.—who’d want her on their team, anyway? What bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasn’t asthma or weak ankles or her being “delicate” that was stopping her. It was her hair. She had mountains of it, twisted this way or that, clipped or beaded, braided or swirled. Her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses. And on the days she let it all hang down, she’d sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket, so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose. Good luck playing four-square with a blanket over your head.</p>
<p>My solution to Shelly Stalls was to ignore her, which worked just dandy until about halfway through the fifth grade when I saw her holding hands with Bryce.</p>
<p>My Bryce. The one who was still embarrassed over holding my hand two days before the second grade. The one who was still too shy to say much more than hello to me.</p>
<p>The one who was still walking around with my first kiss.</p>
<p>How could Shelly have wormed her hand into his? That pushy little princess had no business hanging on to him like that!</p>
<p>Bryce looked over his shoulder from time to time as they walked along, and he was looking at me. My first thought was that he was telling me he was sorry. Then it dawned on me— he needed my help. Absolutely, that’s what it had to be! Shelly Stalls was too delicate to shake off, too swirly to be pushed away. She’d unravel and start sniffling and oh, how embarrassing that would be for him! No, this wasn’t a job a boy could do gracefully. This was a job for a girl.</p>
<p>I didn’t even bother checking around for other candidates—I had her off of him in two seconds flat. Bryce ran away the minute he was free, but not Shelly. Oh, no-no-no! She came at me, scratching and pulling and twisting anything she could get her hands on, telling me that Bryce was hers and there was no way she was letting him go.</p>
<p>How delicate.</p>
<p>I was hoping for herds of teachers to appear so they could see the real Shelly Stalls in action, but it was too late by the time anyone arrived on the scene. I had Fluffy in a headlock and her arm twisted back in a hammerlock, and no amount of her squawking or scratching was going to get me to un lock her until a teacher arrived.</p>
<p>In the end, Shelly went home early with a bad case of mussed-up hair, while I told my side of things to the principal. Mrs. Shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed, and although she told me that it would be better if I let other people work out their own dilemmas, she definitely understood about Shelly Stalls and her hair and told me she was glad I’d had the self-control to do nothing more than restrain her.</p>
<p>Shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids. And of course she got everybody whispering about me, but I just ignored them. The facts spoke for themselves. Bryce didn’t go anywhere near her for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Bryce held my hand after that, but he did start being a little friendlier to me. Especially in the sixth grade, after Mr. Mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Bryce was nice. He was nice. He’d say Hi, Juli to me every morning, and once in a while I’d catch him looking my way. He’d always blush and go back to his own work, and I couldn’t help but smile. He was so shy. And so cute!</p>
<p>We talked to each other more, too. Especially after Mr. Mertins moved me behind him. Mr. Mertins had a detention policy about spelling, where if you missed more than seven out of twenty-five words, you had to spend lunch inside with him, writing your words over and over and over again.</p>
<p>The pressure of detention made Bryce panic. And even though it bothered my conscience, I’d lean in and whisper answers to him, hoping that maybe I could spend lunch with him instead. His hair smelled like watermelon, and his ear-lobes had fuzz. Soft, blond fuzz. And I wondered about that. How does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz? What’s it doing there, anyway? I checked my own ear-lobes in the mirror but couldn’t find much of anything on them, and I didn’t spot any on other people’s either.</p>
<p>I thought about asking Mr. Mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science, but I didn’t. Instead, I spent the year whispering spelling words, sniffing watermelon, and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>作者:宋长征<br>  人住在村子里，养鸡，喂狗，用铡刀铡碎一捆青草，是为了一头牛青青黄黄的日子。鸡会打鸣，会下蛋，会在村前的小河滩上领着一帮子女逮蚂蚱。人也想，可是脱不开身呀，村外的田里种着庄稼，村子里整天发生着大大小小的事情。所以，人想活成一只鸡都不成；再说，鸡的下场也不怎么光荣。狗最会看家，看似卧在墙根下，眯缝着眼，稍有动静，就红了眼，把一个“汪”字重复喊了很多遍。其实，见你一哈腰，便弓了身子，夹起尾巴，钻进一个柴草窠里，再不愿管别人的闲事。人不像狗，要不然，活得多没意义。</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>  牛呢，我不说你也知道。主人下地了，被拴在林东的一棵歪脖子柳树上，日头在东，在西边卧；日头爬上南天门，就靠紧了柳树根。嘴倒嚼着，尾巴甩来甩去，也拍不到一只苍蝇；日头落在屋檐上的时候，牛们大都站起身来，朝着庄稼地的方向，哞——哞——喊了两嗓子，不大会儿就有人走了过来。天就黑了。</p>
<p>  庄稼住在地里。南岗子，西水洼，起起伏伏，不咋平坦的老河滩上都是庄稼的家。眼下，庄稼做不了自己的主，村子里住的有的是人。别看平常不怎么出来，开春了，动镰了，一个个像从战壕里跃出来的士兵，跟无形的时光拼着抢着，不过是为了果腹，重复上演着祖先继续了很多年的战争。庄稼一开始不大理会这个，好像有了人，日子便再不会像草那么索然无趣。老河滩上的草就没人管，发芽了，开花了，结果了。羊呢，比较挑嘴，喜欢的，抿在嘴里，不紧不慢，咀嚼着光阴；不喜欢的，比如刺老牙，打了个响鼻，分明在告诉自己的子女：那玩意儿碰不得。</p>
<p>  至于庄稼到底羡不羡慕草的活法，这个你得问庄稼。反正，乡下有风也有雨，有寂寞的寒冬，也有漫长而火热的盛夏，草能忍受，庄稼也不惧怕——脚下一样是贫瘠或者丰腴的土地，头上是或阴或暗的天，生长时不妨昂首向天，成熟时不妨低头看地。这日子，悠悠远远，不也已经走了很多年？</p>
<p>  凝望炊烟，静听流年。</p>
<p>  人这一辈子啊，还真是有些复杂,不能像一棵庄稼，在野地里生长。像蚂蚁那样日日辛劳，不过是为了寻找一个遮风避雨的处所。村子就是一个蚂蚁窝，一个个老去的蚂蚁靠在土墙根下晒太阳。他们拿不起锄头了，也背不起草筐，眼看着村口那棵刺槐树上的叶子落了一片又一片，老去的脉络里已寻找不到春天的影像。他们却又无限希望，看着咿咿呀呀在土里打滚的娃儿们笑得合不拢嘴。也许吧，咀嚼了那么些年的庄稼子孙，此时已风化在泥土，紧紧握住一条根，千叮咛万嘱咐，一定不要错过时光，记得在春天上路。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼就是一种温暖——但不一定就是粮食。十月的棉田迎来了收获云的季节，那些丝丝绒绒的棉絮，将被村庄里勤劳的妇女采收在贴身的布兜，在一个个寂寞的夜里，嘤嘤，嘤嘤，纺织着平凡的一生。那些棉的温度，从此将披在男人身上，暖在男人的脚上，甚至，远在千里的儿女，从邮局的包裹里，轻轻，轻轻，取出，一种暖意会霎时夺眶而出。远在天涯的你，是否也在牵挂这样一种温暖，那细密的针脚，就是一个母亲用尽一生写满的爱的叮咛。</p>
<p>  一棵庄稼长啊长，分明在汲取天地日月的精华。有一种庄稼叫谷子，细细的茎，狭长的叶子，于夏日的某天，被一粒粒点进田里。阳光有多热烈，生命就有多少激情，他们扎根，分蘖，像风一样顶着七月的流火往上蹿。</p>
<p>  静止，就是静美。这是在秋天，才能体悟到的一种美丽情愫。满地的谷子啊，穗头，比麦子大了好几倍，齐刷刷低下谦卑的头颅。稻草人适时登场，这个陪伴了土地与乡村多少年的神秘人物，就像一尊神的雕像。或者，凝视了乡村很久，像一位普渡众生的圣母，轻轻一拂，谷子便在这个季节迅速膨胀，给贫瘠的家园以最大的希望，让男儿如山，让女儿如花，继续奔跑在乡村或乡村以外的岁月。</p>
<p>  学做一棵庄稼不容易。</p>
<p>  七奶放下手中的镰刀，向远处张望。她在等谁呢？哪怕一阵风能捎来马儿的消息也好。马儿是七奶的长子，七奶一天念叨一百遍也不觉得唠叨，这样，七奶在乡下寂寞的夜里再不会哭泣。</p>
<p>  马儿嘬加鸡蛋红糖的小米粥长大，长大了的马儿是一条骏逸的小马驹。马儿上学了。马儿落榜了。马儿在家门口不怕风吹雨打太阳晒，蚊子咬了浑身红疙瘩，也不肯放弃学习。马儿参军了。马儿考上了军医大学。马儿娶妻了。马儿提干了……马儿却很少再回家。到后来，村里人再也没见过马儿的踪影。</p>
<p>  木匠六爷说了：人啊，咋还不如一棵庄稼。</p>
<p>  人呐，有时候真的不如一棵庄稼。一棵庄稼离村庄很近，见风就长，绝不辜负乡下母亲期盼的眼神。纺成丝线，不是为了牵绊，是为了寄托一种远在天涯的温暖；熬一碗热粥，不是为了挽留，是为了把积攒一生的祝福装进儿女的兜。想念时，哪怕是梦呓也会叫出最亲最暖的那个字——娘。</p>
<p>  玉米又长起来了，蝉的歌唱得无比嘹亮，村庄在仲夏的氤氲里安详。人还是村子里的人，唤狗的唤狗，撵鸡的撵鸡，把日子过得琐琐碎碎，细细长长。一棵庄稼在田野里，听风，听雨，听蟋蟀柔柔的丝弦，明明知道人其实高不过一棵庄稼，也不炫耀所谓的丰功伟绩。</p>
<p>  其实，人知道就好。知道了一棵庄稼的高度，才能仔细审视脚下的土地，无论走多远，不忘却，不迷惘，就会像一棵庄稼，明晰自己的方向。哪怕最后化身为土，也会在来生茁壮。</p>
